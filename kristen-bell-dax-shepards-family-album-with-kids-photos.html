They <a href=#>tied the knot three years later</a> after same sex marriage became legal in California.</p><p>The lovebirds soon expanded their family, welcoming Lincoln in March 2013 and Delta in December 2014. Over the years, Shepard and <a href=#>The Good Place</a> alum have kept their girls out of the limelight, but that hasn’t stopped them from <a href=#>sharing stories of their highs and lows as parents</a>.</p><p>“[Dax] said, ‘Kids can see adults fight, particularly their parents, but you ever think about the follow through? When do they see them resolve it? When do they see them make up? And kids mimic us. That’s how they grow,’” Bell <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly</a> in August 2017 of how the pair handle arguments. “We always make an effort to make them see. So the next morning I’ll say, ‘Hey, you know what Dad, I’m really sorry I was so frustrated yesterday when you were bringing in the groceries. I could have had a nicer tone in my voice.’”</p><p>She continued: “And he would say, ‘Thanks for saying that, Mom, I know you were stressed.’ And we let our kids see how to solve conflict and that was his idea. And if we don’t genuinely wake up like that in front of each other, we will write the script to make them see.”</p><p>The <a href=#>Veronica Mars</a> alum gushed over <a href=#>the “Armchair Expert” podcast host</a>’s approach to teaching their girls how to become better people. “It’s cute, right? That’s Dax Shepard’s parenting skills right there,” she added. “He who has not read a single parenting book. I, who have read most of them, and he comes up with the golden gems. Can you believe this guy?”</p><p>Bell later confessed that “parenting is a lot like sports — you’re either winning or losing every minute of the day.” She explained during an October 2021 episode of <a href=#>Momsplaining With Kristen Bell</a> that raising kids can be “mostly losing, but that’s what makes the winning so sweet, and fleeting.”</p><p>While the twosome are vocal about how they parent, they keep their daughters’ faces off social media when possible. In August 2022, however, the actors shared <a href=#>a series of photos from their family RV trip</a> through the United States.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Heaven isn’t a place on Earth, but rather many many places on Earth best seen from behind the wheel of #BigBrown,” Shepard captioned Instagram snaps of the group exploring waterfalls and the great outdoors.</p><p>Scroll down to see some of Bell and Shepard’s cutest family moments:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkuLO10q2cp2WSmrmtecOar2armJq9or7DrGSfmZ2eubp5wKWZrqVdrLa1tIykoJ2rXaW1sMDOrGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./take-twos-eddie-cibrian-shares-secrets-about-rachel-bilson-watch.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Take Two's Eddie Cibrian Shares Secrets About Rachel Bilson: Watch</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kathy-riley-obituary-beloved-evan-mcdonald-pays-tribute.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kathy Riley Obituary, Beloved Evan McDonald Pays Tribute</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
