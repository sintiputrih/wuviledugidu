Millions of people follow her on Instagram, thousands flock to the Waco Silos every year, and who among us can claim we’ve never bought something from her collection at Target?</p><p>When she’s not owning the heck out of her multi-million-dollar business, Joanna is living it up with her family of five adorable kids (and husband Chip, of course). Family has always been super important to Joanna, including her own family of origin. Meet <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Joanna Gaines’ siblings</u></a>, Teresa Ann and Mary Kay.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Sister love. #nationalsiblingday ❤️</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Joanna Stevens Gaines</a> (@joannagaines) on Apr 10, 2016 at 5:29pm PDT</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Joanna Gaines’ siblings?</h2><p>Joanna is the middle child in her family. She has an older sister, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Teresa Ann Criswell</u></a>, and a younger sister named Mary Kay McCall. While Joanna certainly spends the most time in the spotlight, Mary Kay and Teresa have both forged their own paths and all three sisters seem to be super supportive of one another.</p><p>Oldest sister Teresa hosts a weekly inspirational YouTube show called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Let’s Talk with Teresa Ann</u></a>. One glimpse at her studio reveals that she’s also a fan of the farmhouse-chic style her sister has mastered. Teresa has also written several books and hosts a podcast with her daughter Tristin.</p><p>Youngest sister Mary Kay McCall’s life is also super busy — she and her husband David have six young children! You may remember Mary Kay (or “Mikey,” as she’s affectionately known) from an episode of Fixer Upper. Joanna and Chip worked to renovate a home for Mary Kay and her family when they moved back to Waco after nine years away.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Today's house was my all time favorite #fixerupper ...we got to reveal this house to my sweet sis and her family of seven (going on 8!).

Right after the episode aired, Joanna and Chip made their own pregnancy announcement, revealing that the sisters were actually pregnant at the same time!</p><p>Now that Mary Kay and David’s huge family is living in Waco, we can only imagine all the fun that all of those cousins will have growing up together. Between Mary Kay’s six kids and Joanna’s five, we’re sure there’s never a dull moment at family gatherings, especially when Teresa Ann brings her family by, too.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Joanna speaks often about how her parents inspire her.</h2><p>Teresa Ann, Joanna, and Mary Kay are the three children of parents Jerry and Nan. Jerry is half-Lebanese and half-German, while Nan is Korean. The two met in Seoul, Korea while Jerry was serving during the Vietnam War.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Happy 45th Anniversary to these two! My parents met in 1969 when my dad was stationed in Korea and their story is one you hear about in the movies.
