It was announced back in 2012 that the two had officially retired from acting and would be focusing all of their time and energy into their biggest fashion line to date, The Row.</p><p>Despite fans missing the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olsen twins</a> from their television screens, it appears as if they have found even more success in the fashion industry. It was announced that both Mary-Kate and Ashley had created an empire that has been priced at over $1 billion, making it clear that the two have certainly found their niche and are executing it exceptionally well. Here is everything the Olsen twins have been up to since their departure from the big-screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=moving-on-from-the-big-screen><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Moving On From The Big Screen</span></h2><p>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are the epitome of child star actors! The two have been appearing on our television screens for as long as we can remember, however, it appears that they have taken an official step back from the big screen. After appearing in over 20 movies and TV shows such as "Full House", "New York Minute", "Passport To Paris" and "It Takes Two", the Olsen twins have yet to appear in any film or television production since 2011 after both having roles in the film "Beastly".</p><h2 id=they-took-control-of-their-entertainment-company><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Took Control Of Their Entertainment Company</span></h2><p>After stepping away from the big screen in 2011, the Olsen twins officially stated that they would be retiring from acting for good in 2012 to focus on their fashion lines. During their time on-screen, most of their films and television shows were produced by Dualstar Entertainment Group. This privately owned liability company has now been officially taken over by both Mary-Kate and Ashley and is now used to produce and market their many lines that including fragrance, clothing, and accessories.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-have-become-fashion-icons><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They Have Become Fashion Icons</span></h2><p>Since their debut on-screen, the Olsen twins have been trendsetters! Although they were styled for most of their careers on-screen, the two have taken total control of their looks since retiring from acting. The two have gone ahead and managed to make what has been referred to as the "homeless look" one of the most sought out trends in fashion. Additionally, the twins, who no longer appear on the red carpet as often as they once did, remain two of the most sought out people by the paparazzi just to get shots of their outfits.</p><h2 id=they-served-as-the-faces-for-many-designers><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Served As The Faces For Many Designers</span></h2><p>Considering just how fashion-forward Mary-Kate and Ashley are, it is no surprise that they have been selected by a number of designers to be the face of their lines. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Badgley Mischka announced way back in 2006, that the Olsen twins would be hopping on board as the face of the couture line</a>. The two have also gone on to represent for massive fashion houses such as Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, and Givenchy, which the two have worn absolutely brilliantly with their own personal twist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How To Master The Olsen Twin's Look: According To Their Hairstylist</a></span></p><h2 id=olsen-twins-created-their-own-couture-fashion-label><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Olsen Twins Created Their Own Couture Fashion Label</span></h2><p>When it came time to retire from film and television, it was no surprise that the Olsen twin's next project would be a fashion line of their own. The two have since been regarded as owning a multi-billion dollar fashion empire, and it all started with their couture line, The Row. The idea first developed back in 2006, however, it wasn't until 2014 that Mary-Kate and Ashley had opened their first store in Los Angeles and two years later a store in New York City. They have since gone on to create an entire menswear line under the same label and have continued to expand their business by showing their lines at both New York and Paris Fashion Week and at the Château de Courances in France.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-even-created-their-own-line-at-walmart><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>They Even Created Their Own Line At Walmart</span></h2><p>While The Row is easily a more upscale couture fashion brand, the Olsen twins have also gone ahead and created a more affordable line for both kids and adults at Walmart and Kohls! Mary-Kate and Ashley have focused on their lines, which are made for girls aged 4 - 14 in Walmart stores across North America, as well as their very own beauty line, which is called "Mary-Kate and Ashley: Real Fashion For Real Girls". It is no surprise that they have amassed so much success throughout their fashion adventures and it appears as if they are not stopping anytime soon.</p><h2 id=both-olsen-s-have-had-their-ups-amp-downs-with-relationships><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Both Olsen's Have Had Their Ups & Downs With Relationships</span></h2><p>In addition to taking over the fashion industry, both Mary-Kate and Ashley have also found love in their lives. Both sisters appear to have a thing for older men, considering Ashley Olsen dated former boyfriend, Richard Sachs, who was nearly 60 years old, and Mary-Kate married hubby Olivier Sarkozy, who is 17 years her senior. Despite finding partners, Ashley Olsen has since moved onto Louis Eisner, a 30 years old artist, all while Mary-Kate Olsen is undergoing a divorce from Sarkozy. The two have been married since 2015, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appear to have clashed over wanting kids</a> since Mary-Kate is far younger than Sarkozy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A Look At Mary-Kate & Olivia Sarkozy's Relationship Timeline</a></span></p><h2 id=mary-kate-is-a-step-mother><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mary-Kate Is A Step Mother</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>5 </span><span></span></h2><p>Although the two are currently filing for divorce, Mary-Kate Olsen has not also been a wife for the last 5 years, but she has also been a step-mom. The 33-year-old has discussed her new lifestyle as a step-mom claiming she heads home and cooks for the kids whenever they are staying over at their house. While you might think that someone who owns a multi-billion dollar fashion empire would have help at home, it appears as if Mary-Kate took on the role herself and requires no additional hands.</p><h2 id=they-are-regular-attendees-of-the-met-gala><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>They Are Regular Attendees Of The Met Gala</span></h2><p>If they aren't launching new collections, fragrances or appearing at the most prestigious fashion weeks across the globe, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen are attending the Met Gala. While the two were expected to appear at this year's esteemed fashion event, fans will have to wait until next year's Gala to see what the Olsen twins bring to the pink carpet. Both Mary-Kate and Ashley take on the years theme with a twist of their own, and always arrive looking incredible. If they aren't being dressed by a specific designer, the two always opt for vintage pieces that always steal the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-won-t-find-them-on-social-media><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>You Won't Find Them On Social Media</span></h2><p>If you have ever wondered what Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen have been up to, you would notice that there is no way of finding anything out on social media, and that is because the two are not to be found anywhere! Mary-Kate and Ashley have made it clear that they have no interest in joining Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter, and choose to market and advertise their lines through other mediums. Considering how big social media is for many fashion lines, it is surprising to know that the two don't even use social media for their own collections!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Is What It's Like To Work For Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen</a></span></p><h2 id=they-published-their-very-own-book><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Published Their Very Own Book</span></h2><p>Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen also have a knack for book writing!

In addition to the lengthy interview found throughout the book, the twins also included a series of stunning black and white photos, which creates an overall stunning non-fiction read that we'd totally recommend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-have-received-many-accolades-for-their-work-in-fashion><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Have Received Many Accolades For Their Work In Fashion</span></h2><p>Considering just how much the women worked on their own fashion lines both high end and low end, fragrance collections, and collaborations with many designers, they have since received a number of fashion accolades.
