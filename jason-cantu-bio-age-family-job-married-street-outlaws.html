Jason Cantu, whom we are going to discuss in the rest of this writing, is also a household name among these people as the Street Outlaws star’s life revolves around modifying and racing cars.</p><p>Now, the ‘Jason Cantu Bio’.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Jason Cantu Street Outlaws</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Jason is one of the stars of the show who has appeared in more than one Street Outlaws spinoff, including Street Outlaws: America’s List and Street Outlaws: Fastest in America.</p><p style=text-align:left>By the look of things, the reality star is not just putting on a pretense for the cameras but he actually lives and breathes all things automobile. He is a favorite on Street Outlaws for piloting a heavily modified Chevrolet S-10. His vehicle, which is nicknamed “La Vicktoria” is also the name of his Facebook page; is packed with over 1,500 horsepower; is fed to it by a massive turbocharger.</p><p class=_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM>In one of the first episodes of the show in recent times, Jason’s costars Murillo and Birdman were talking to JJ about their team, the topic of Jason came up and they quickly said he is not with Team Texas and said he is a traitor. So, he basically comes off as douche on the show.</p><p>Jason also previously fought Brian “Chucky” Davis. This event in the summer of 2021 in fact counted as one of Jason’s most viral moments on the show. The fight included Jason attacking Brian from behind after a heated disagreement. After the episode aired, fans had discussed their disagreement with Jason’s actions online.</p><p>Jason also has had a few crashes on the Discovery show, including that on time when he raced Jackie Knox Sr at Edinburg Motorsports Park. His truck had climbed the railing before flipping multiple times, but thankfully he came out of the incident unharmed.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Jason Cantu Job</strong></h3><p>When he is not racing La Vicktoria on the street, Jason is a passionate mechanic.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Jason Cantu Married?</strong></h3><p>Street Outlaws star Jason Cantu is married to <a href=#>Jessica Olvera</a> and together they reportedly also have two young sons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/jason-cantu-bio-age-family-job-married-street-outlaws-2022-1-300x300.jpg><p>Most recently in March 2022, Jason wished his wife on a Facebook that read “HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my better half Jessica Olvera.

Even though we’ve been together for 23 years, we’ve always seen ourselves as a married couple. I think it’s time we make it official… She was surprised.”</p><p>“An anniversary is that point in a love’s journey where one can pause and realize how they have been so lucky! I’m lucky to have found you so many years ago and I look forward to the rest of our lives together! Happy 19th-anniversary baby! Our day started off a little rocky (damn that wind 😂) but I know the day will get better because I’m spending it with you! Love you to the moon and back, to infinity and beyond, forever and ever, amen! 😍😘”, this (of course) was their 19th marriage anniversary post made on Facebook on 24 April 2017.</p><p>Lastly, his wife, born in March 1980, turned 42 years old in 2022.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Jason Cantu Age</strong></h3><p>Jason Cantu was born in 1979.
