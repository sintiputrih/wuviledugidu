The University of Oxford published research and in it, Cook’s leadership style was characterized as being paradigmatic of founder centrism.

He closed factories and warehouses, exchanging them with contract manufacturers. This led to a reduction in the company’s inventory from months to days. His group decided to invest in long-term deals such as advance investment in flash memory from 2005 onward as they predicted its importance. This assured there was a stable supply of what became a key iPod Nano, then iPhone and iPad component. Competitors at Hewlett-Packard, describing their canceled TouchPad tablet computer, later said that it was made from “cast-off reject iPad parts.”</p><p>Cook’s efforts were credited with keeping costs under control, combined with the company’s design and marketing savvy, generated huge profits.

These changes occurred after the third quarter of the fiscal year when revenues and profits grew less than predicted.</p><p>In May 2013, he said that his leadership at Apple focuses on people, strategy, and execution. Going on to explain, he said, “If you get those three right the world is a great place.” The incorporated company has also increased its donations to charity since Cook took over from Steve Jobs.
