In Episode 8 of 'House Of Payne', Miranda's desperation to get Calvin back seems to have finally paid off. Lately, she has been expressing her doubts about her divorce with him and crying to everyone she meets. She tried to stage an awkward run-in with him earlier at CJ and Janine's house and he walked out, just after seeing her. Calvin has many doubts and is even more hurt that his mother Ella (Cassi Davis) has been talking to Miranda. He is so hurt that he storms out on Ella and slams the door shut. However, you don't mess with Ella and she comes charging back at him, giving him a lecture on disrespecting his mother. And as she's leaving, she ensures that Miranda gets to have her say.</p><p>Miranda begs for Calvin to come back, and keeps saying that he misses her. After refusing adamantly, Calvin melts and the two share a kiss. Cute, but fans are not willing to forgive Miranda as they say that she was the one who walked out on him. They labeled her as toxic and said that Calvin deserves infinitely better than her.</p><p>"I knew from the beginning Calvin and Miranda were going to be a disaster. Janine and C.J. are BLESSED!! Married couples give up too easily, too selfish. Miranda knew what kind of man Calvin is and she still chose to marry him and give him a son #HouseOfPayne," a fan tweeted.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I knew from the beginning Calvin and Miranda were going to be a disaster.
