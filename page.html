Jack and I hadn’t been to the store in weeks. After eating our way through boxes of pasta and bags of white rice, the black rice was an exciting change. Thanks to its nutty flavor and striking purple hue, black rice, also called forbidden rice, had been one of my favorite grains when we lived in Austin. I’d get it from the bulk bins at the grocery store, eagerly anticipating adding it to salads and bowls when I got home.

I wanted to make vegan sushi that looked like, well,&nbsp;not&nbsp;vegan sushi. I thought that if I marinated pink Chioggia beets they’d look pretty darn similar to tuna. How cute would that be?! There was just one problem: Jack hates beets. Sure, he’ll eat certain beet recipes from time to time, but that only happens when I put a dish in front of him and don’t tell him what’s in it. And in our house, vegan sushi is one thing we…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Raise your hand if you love miso soup! Same. The cloudy broth is warming, nourishing, and deeply flavorful. On a cold, gray winter day, there’s nothing I crave more. It clears my head and warms me up from the inside out. For years, I only ate miso soup at Japanese restaurants. But after Jack and I traveled to Japan for the first time, we got curious about Japanese cooking at home. We cooked soba noodles, we made matcha, and we decided to try a miso soup recipe.

If you saw my post over the weekend, you know that I get tons of questions about plant-based eating at this time of year. It makes sense – in the last few years, plant-based diets have gotten a lot of press. They’re said to be better for your health and better for the planet. What’s not to love? Well, many people don’t know where to start. Sure, they know that they should eat whole grains, veggies, fruits, and legumes. But while these components are nutritious, they don’t add…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy New Year! Every January, the most common question readers ask me is, “What is a plant-based diet?” “Plant-based” is such a trendy term these days, and if you’ve been reading the blog for a while, you’ve probably seen me use it. But…what exactly does it mean? You asked, I answered! Today, I’m sharing an overview of plant-based eating. This post is not intended to offer dietary, nutrition, or health advice. Instead, I hope it clears up some confusion about what people (including me!) mean when they say “plant-based.” And in case you’re considering – or already follow – a…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>On the internet, kale recipes were all the rage a few years ago. But in my kitchen, they’re just as cool as ever. What can I say? Kale is versatile, it’s delicious, and it just so happens to be one of the healthiest veggies out there. You betcha I’m blending it into smoothies, tossing it into pastas, and simmering it in soups whenever I have the chance! At this time of year, many people start to think about adding more veggies to their diets. If that includes you, I encourage you to try kale!
