Tiny, crowded handwriting, also known as micrographia, is frequently <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>one of the early symptoms</a> of the disease, according to the Parkinson's Foundation.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>Parkinson's affects the brain in a way that can lead to "movements are that slower and smaller than normal," <strong>James Beck</strong>, PhD, the Parkinson Foundation's <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Chief Scientific Officer</a> told&nbsp;Best Life. So, considering it requires movement, the handwriting of a person with Parkinson's will likely begin to shrink and slow as well.</p><p>Physician <strong>Chris Airey</strong>, MD,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>medical director</a> at Optimale, confirms that "a sudden change to small handwriting can be a sign that a person is beginning to find it difficult to control the movement of their hand and exercise fine motor skills such as writing."</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>96 Percent of People With Parkinson's Have This in Common, Study Says</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/03/woman-walking-park-steps-needed-daily.jpg><p>Though a change in handwriting could be due to something else, Beck says there are a handful of other <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/news-parkinsons-risk-live/ data-target=_blank data-rel=noopener>early signs of Parkinson's</span> to look out for, including constipation, a diminished sense of smell, and reduced arm swing when walking. "A common Parkinson's disease symptom is stiffness," said Beck. "This will usually be described as a sore shoulder. The joint is fine, but the muscles, due to the disease, are very rigid and can be painful to move." Physically active people may also notice their coordination is reduced while engaging with things they used to be good at, such as golf or tennis.</p><p>According to Airey, other common early signs of Parkinson's include "shuffling gait, tremors in your hands or legs, and sleeping issues such as insomnia or sleep apnea."</p><p class=p1><strong>For more health news delivered straight to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/man-writing.jpg><p>If you notice your handwriting has shrunk, of course you should talk to your doctor about it. And if you are in fact dealing with micrographia brought on by Parkinson's, Beck says there are medications that can help control movement symptoms that may help slightly.</p><p>There are also a handful of exercises you can do to help make writing more comfortable for you and clearer for readers. The Parkinson's Foundation suggests practicing writing bigger on one page a day, using lined paper, taking breaks, and sitting upright at a table—these are all small things that could help your micrographia.</p><p>You can also work with an occupational therapist who can provide specific activities to help you with your handwriting.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/handwriting.jpg><p>If your handwriting begins to get smaller, there's a good chance your signature may change as well—and it's important to document the shift, the Parkinson's Foundation notes. "When it comes to legal documents—from financial documents to advanced directives and planned giving—have your lawyer prepare several formal witnessed and notarized affidavits which you sign at different points during the day to document the changes in your signature," suggests the foundation. Having this can be helpful down the line if your signatures aren't matching up.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/news-early-sign-parkinsons/ data-target=_blank data-rel=noopener>If You Do This at Night, It May Be an Early Sign of Parkinson's, Study Says</span>.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmoZmemcSztdOipaBloJa%2FrLXNrKanq12jsri%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./julian-crouser-net-worth-293506.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Julian Crouser Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./blake-lively-boyfriends-from-teen-dream-to-hollywood-power-couple.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>From Teen Dream To Hollywood Power Couple Rallshe</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
