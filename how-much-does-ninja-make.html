Back when <strong>Richard Tyler Blevins</strong> — who goes by the moniker “Ninja” in the online world — got his start, gaming was far from becoming the respected career path it is today. These days, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">professional gamers rake in cash</a> for their contributions to popular eSports groups like Cloud9 and FaZe Clan, as well as for simple uploads of their favorite in-game moments, but this is a relatively recent change.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja</a></strong> is a large contributor to this change as one of the Western world’s first prominent figures in competitive online gaming. His star has faded somewhat as the field has become more populated with streamers, but Ninja will always be among the gamers who paved the way for those who came after.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=660 data-injectable=true>Ninja first came to mainstream prominence in 2018, after his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite streams</a> on Twitch began to break records. Since then, the streamer — rocking a range of brilliantly-colored hair — has maintained his status as one of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch’s top earners</a>. With more than 18 million followers, he is also the most-followed channel on the video game streaming platform.</p><p data-characters=313 data-current-count=313 data-injectable=false>This popularity also extends to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>, where Ninja has amassed upwards of 24 million subscribers. His YouTube channel, which has been around since 2011, has collected a staggering total view count of more than 2.4 billion, with most individual videos earning view counts in the hundreds of thousands, at least.</p><p data-characters=495 data-current-count=808 data-injectable=true>This year, he was named one of Forbes‘ “Top Creators of 2023.” He was one of very few streamers/video game creators to make the list, indicating how influential he is in the space. Ninja also created a podcast this year, called “AFK w/Ninja”, allowing him to connect with his fans even more. In addition, he joined GameSquare in February of this year as its chief innovation officer. In this role, he will be spearheading the talent incubator’s growth opportunities.</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=195 data-injectable=false>Despite the greater competition he now faces in the eSports arena, Ninja has maintained as one of the gaming world’s most recognizable figures, leading many to wonder how much he is now worth.</p><h2 id=h-ninja-s-net-worth-explained data-injectable=false>Ninja’s net worth explained</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=495 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=217 data-injectable=false>All the work Ninja has done over the last several years <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has paid off in a big way</a>. The popular gamer was making “a lot more” than $500,000 a month back at the peak of his popularity in 2018, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dexerto</a>.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=644 data-injectable=true>While that monthly revenue has likely decreased somewhat, he still makes an enviable living through advertisements, partnerships, and donations. Add to this the money he makes through YouTube and his apparel line ⏤ fittingly themed around “Team Ninja”⏤ and his earnings get a big boost. His online shop offers a variety of gaming-centric merchandise, including a range of brightly-colored casual attire and outerwear.&nbsp;</p><a class=wp-block-dotesports-affiliate-button__link href=# rel="nofollow sponsored noopener noreferrer">See Prime Video on Amazon</a><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>When all is said and done, Ninja is estimated to have a net worth of around $40 million in 2023, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>. This is particularly impressive given the creator’s young age ⏤ he turned 32 earlier this year ⏤ and comparatively sparse presence on YouTube.</p><p data-characters=193 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=false>Even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">without daily uploads</a>, Ninja<strong> </strong>is going strong. He continues to dominate a field he helped to legitimize, and⏤despite the <a href=#>occasional contr</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">o</a><a href=#>versy</a>⏤seems poised to do so for years to come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeppMK1wcGeZqGnp2K6tq%2FHZpuonaNiu6q6yZpkppmbmnw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./keegan-allen-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Keegan Allen Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./halle-baileys-boyfriend-ddg-says-her-pregnancy-just-kinda-happened.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Halle Bailey's Boyfriend DDG Says Her Pregnancy 'Just Kinda Happened'</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
