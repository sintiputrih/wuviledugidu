The truTV series kicks off with Michael usually pretending to be a retail employee, while the final, longer act is more elaborate and requires more planning.&nbsp;</p><p>To accomplish this, Michael and his team use six cameras to capture all the action, and simple tricks like footprint decals to subconsciously encourage people into the right position. And yes, it usually requires more than one take.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>"We really don’t know how it’s going to play out," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Blurred</a>. "It’s amazing that it works."&nbsp;</p><p>He went on to admit the show is extensively edited, but not the way you think. "The show is edited judiciously,” he added. "At any given moment, with six cameras rolling,&nbsp;five of them are seeing how the trick works."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He continued, "So, yes, definitely, I’m editing around and showcasing what you would be going through if you were there."&nbsp;</p><p>This means the reactions on the show are 100 percent authentic — even if it takes a bit of work. If someone recognizes him, which happens approximately one-third of the time, he will just move on to the next person.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Participants don't even realize they are wearing a microphone until after the reveal, thanks to Michael's sleight-of-hand abilities. "As a magician, it’s like a reverse pick-pocket," he explained before adding, "I really do a good job. I’ve never taken somebody so far they were terribly upset. Maybe I’m like that sarcastic person — I get away with it."&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Michael Carbonaro married?&nbsp;</h2><p>Now, the more important question: is Michael single? Sorry, but Michael has been married to his husband, Peter Sickles, since 2014. "Married life is awesome," he previously told the<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Orlando Sentinel</a>. "We’re really good for each other. We met in New York. We’ve been together 12 years.

"ATTENTION CLASS — A big batch of 2019 #CarbonaroLIVE dates have just been added," he wrote. "Tickets on sale Fri, 12/21, but jump over to<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> MichaelCarbonaro.com </a>for sneaky pre-sale deets starting tomorrow, 12/19.
