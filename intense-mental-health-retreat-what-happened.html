A weekend of pure yoga or meditation sounded like a rather flimsy plaster when faced with the rigmarole of a 9-5 job and the stresses of life, but that’s why this retreat appealed to me.</p><p id=e4ZiBTkg1FD data-wc=44>Dr. Elena Touroni, co-founder of <strong>The Chelsea Psychology Clinic</strong>, agreed that most retreats tended to focus on one dimension of wellness, so she set about changing that, offering a stay that comprises a variety of modalities, with the programme bespoke to each individual attendee.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewmhoqUGgSX data-wc=26>Pilates instructors, motion release therapists, psychologists and psychiatrists, mindfulness experts, nutritionists and sleep doctors came together to provide a comprehensive, evidence-based response to your personal goals.&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I handed over my phone for 3 days - and the results surprised me" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/3427461fb955-cabin-stay.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I handed over my phone for 3 days - and the results surprised me" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I handed over my phone for 3 days - and the results surprised me</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I went for a walk every day - here's what it did to my stress levels" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/88c3459ba480-walking2.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I went for a walk every day - here's what it did to my stress levels" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I went for a walk every day - here's what it did to my stress levels</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Burnout: How 5 days disconnected from the world changed my life" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/1f02126dcded-colombia.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Burnout: How 5 days disconnected from the world changed my life" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Burnout: How 5 days disconnected from the world changed my life</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=e6w89kbWcus data-wc=65>And the bespoke, personalised aspect was essential. Ahead of the retreat I had an intense 90-minute session to ascertain what I needed to address, with the stay tailored to my needs - which turned out to be an overwhelming need to rest after four relentless years in which I graduated from university during a global pandemic, moved to London and started carving out my career.</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>My retreat experience</strong></h2><p id=ePEjLuy3snT data-wc=34>In some ways, the retreat was exactly what I expected. We'd get up at 7:15am and do pilates, complete group sessions together - such as motion release therapy, a mindful walk, and sound baths.&nbsp;</p><p id=emYiOZKf_0D data-wc=48>It helped that the retreat took place in Charlotte Church's fairytale-like haven, The Dreaming, in the rolling hills of Rhayader. Not only were you enveloped in the greenery of rural Wales, with its moss-crested stream and waterfall among the trees, but there was no signal or Wi-Fi. Bliss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6bc18ee51fc1-202403chelseapsychologyclinicretreatphilippalangley753philippalangley.jpg><p id=e22SDpGSf_i data-wc=14>Magical location aside, the experience sparkled in how deeply tailored it was to you.&nbsp;</p><p id=ezrhKb82qUu data-wc=24>Between group sessions, I had one-on-one sessions to tackle my goals, and much of my experience focussed on how I had become emotionally exhausted.</p><p id=ePpyVo1sCV data-wc=12><strong>INSPIRATION:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>5 ways therapy can make you happier according to the experts</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eeEFZ-QEtJP data-wc=64>In a one-on-one with a mindfulness expert, we reframed my discontent with my life to ask the question: How closely am I aligning with my values? Using a bullseye image split in four categories to assess my career, relationships, spiritual life and free time to mark where I am, and how to get closer to the centre circle and align fully with my values.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/590519629518-202403chelseapsychologyclinicretreatphilippalangley299philippalangley.jpg><p id=eXRZKn_15n data-wc=64>Perhaps you might have read this far and thought: "That sounds far too intense for me". You might not be able to imagine yourself adhering to a rigorous structure - but the schedule wasn't set in stone. Every day you would have a session with a psychologist assigned as your host to discuss whether you were getting everything you needed out of the retreat.&nbsp;</p><h2 dir=ltr><strong>Forcing me to rest</strong></h2><p id=ezbbaHiDzUu data-wc=46>My host questioned whether - in the packed daily routine - I was getting enough rest. When I expressed guilt at not attending every session, she subbed out a nutrition session - discussing intuitive eating and the gut-brain axis - for two hours of enforced rest.</p><p id=eoLUR11wfQE data-wc=5>"Doctor's orders", she said ruefully.</p><p id=eAXcH53Rz6 data-wc=13><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>I was chronically busy – here's how I finally learned to rest</a></strong></p><p id=ea86OHoC-WJ6 data-wc=52>There was something radical about being forced not to be productive. In those two hours on my own, I napped and read my book. But I didn't realise how much I would learn about myself from simply taking a break. I had forgotten that the very act of rest could be restorative.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5efed02acfb7-202403chelseapsychologyclinicretreatphilippalangley524philippalangley.jpg><p id=eznW-Bs3N6vm data-wc=43>This retreat might not be for you if you are essentially looking to do nothing for a weekend.
