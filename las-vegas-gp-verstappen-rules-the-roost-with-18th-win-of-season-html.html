It was definitely a lot of fun."</p><p>Red Bull played the timeless Elvis song over the team radio, after pop star Justin Bieber waved the chequered flag, and Verstappen showed he is a far better driver than singer by joining in.</p><p>Leclerc, whose team are the only ones to beat Red Bull this season, showed all his fighting spirit after the initial setback.</p><p>"I wanted that win so bad but what a race," he gasped over the radio after finishing 2.070 seconds behind Verstappen.</p><p>It was the second race in a row that Perez had lost out on the last lap, with the Mexican passed by Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso at the line in Brazil.</p><p>Perez at least had the consolation of securing second in a championship won long ago by his team mate -- another first for Red Bull who have never previously ended a season with their drivers one-two.</p><p>Esteban Ocon was fourth for Alpine with Lance Stroll fifth for Aston Martin and Ferrari's Carlos Sainz sixth.</p><p>Mercedes' seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton was seventh, ahead of a demoted Russell, Alonso and McLaren's Australian rookie Oscar Piastri, who took a bonus point for fastest lap.</p><p>While Red Bull won both titles long ago, Ferrari closed the gap to second-placed Mercedes to four points with one race remaining in Abu Dhabi.</p><p>The lack of grip was evident from the start as cars accelerated past the floodlit casinos and hotels and down the Strip.</p><p>As Verstappen forced Leclerc wide to take the lead, without giving the place back, Alonso spun and was hit twice by Alfa Romeo's Valtteri Bottas with Perez also involved.</p><p>The Mexican pitted for a new front wing as the virtual safety car was deployed but McLaren's Lando Norris then brought out the full safety car when he crashed on lap three.</p><p>Norris was taken to the University Medical Centre for further precautionary investigations.</p><p>When racing resumed on lap seven, stewards handed Verstappen a five second penalty but he shrugged off the decision. "Yeah, that's fine, send them my regards," he told race engineer Gianpiero Lambiase.</p><p>Leclerc retook the lead on lap 16, with Verstappen pitting and serving the penalty with a 7.7 second stop that dropped him to ninth.</p><p>Perez took over at the front on lap 22 when Leclerc pitted, with the Mexican also helped by the safety car being deployed again on lap 27 to recover debris from the clash between Verstappen and Russell, who was given a five second penalty.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrMmqWoqpGirm%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0e8yoq6iqXai9sL7TrGZraGJofHJ9jmpwaKSRqHq3scaaqmafoGLDpr7SrZipqJWjerPBy56qZqyYmnqzu86sq2avmam1bn2XrZ9mr5mjerCyjKycmqufo3upwMyl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dacey-triplett-bio-age-dating-parents-7-little-johnstons.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet 7 Little Johnstons Star Dacey Triplett!
