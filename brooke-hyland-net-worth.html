According to authoritative sources, this dancer has a net worth of over $250,000, with her wealth being accumulated from her over seven years-long career in the mentioned field. Additionally, she is a singer, and has released one album so far, under the title ‘‘Brooke Hyland’’.</p><h3>Brooke Hyland Net Worth $250,000</h3><p>When it comes to her education, Hyland attended Abby Lee Miller Dance Company, but reportedly began dancing at the age of two. She made her television debut in 2011, beginning to work on ‘‘Dance Moms’’ alongside her mother and her sister, who is also a dancer. The mentioned series, in which she also starred side by side with other dancers such as <a href=#>Maddie Ziegler</a>, <a href=#>Mackenzie Ziegler</a> and <a href=#>Kalani Hilliker</a>, achieved vast success worldwide, and starring in it allowed Brooke to gain more recognition and attention from the media. She remained in the series over the course of next three years, and appeared in 86 episodes. ‘‘Dance Moms’’ follows the group of girls and their mothers, who compete for various dance titles. In the meantime, in 2011 she was featured in the documentary entitled ‘‘Dance Moms: Most Outrageous Moments’’, then in 2013, she was a part of the special entitled ‘‘Dance Moms Christmas Special’’.</p><p>Besides being a dancer and a reality television star, Brooke is also a singer and has released one, self-titled album so far, in August 2013, featuring 10 tracks such as ‘‘Let’s Stop Pretending’’, ‘‘I Hurt’’, ‘‘Wonder’’ and ‘‘You’re the Only One’’. It received mediocre response, although a critic from All Music said that she had a bright singing voice and positive attitude.</p><p>However, Brooke is also an actress and besides acting in her music videos for songs such as ‘‘Brooke Hyland: Mean to Me’’ and ‘‘Brooke Hyland: I Hurt’’, she appeared in ‘‘Just Like Summer’’, made by Lux in 2011, and in which Hyland’s ‘‘Dance Moms’’ companions Chloe, Maddie, Mackenzie and Paige were featured as well.</p><p>When it comes to her private life, Brooke is in a relationship with Nolan Betts, who is two years older than her and whom she reportedly met in high school. She also confessed to having a crush on her co-star. Brandon Pent. She has a sister – Paige – who also participated in ‘‘Dance Moms’’, and a brother named Josh. In her early teens, she injured her foot when it was runover by a golf cart, and there were fears that she wouldn’t be able to dance again, happily unfounded. She is active on social media such as Twitter and Instagram and is followed by 670,000 people on the former and over three million on the latter.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table class=interesting_facts readability=4><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>1</td><td>Brooke is the oldest out of three kids.
