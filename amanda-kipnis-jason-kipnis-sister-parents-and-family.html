Amanda is a teacher at San Altos who teaches baseball to young students in her free time.</p><p>Amanda is not the only sibling of the former MLB player. He has two older brothers, Todd and Blair, who played the game during high school. All four Kipnis siblings have gone on to have different career trajectories.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jason-kipnis.jpg><p>Kipnis might have retired from the MLB, but the former Cleveland player has kept himself in the spotlight. And this time around, it’s because of the comments he reserved for his former teammate, <a href=# rel=noopener>Francisco Lindor Jr</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, in a podcast, Jason pointed fingers at the Mets’ leadership, and when asked about Lindor’s leadership skills, Jason didn’t budge.</p><p>This has now led to Lindor’s wife calling him a bully. It looks like another case of a former teammate turned into a foe.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jason Kipnis Sister Amanda Kipnis&nbsp;</h2><p>Jason Kipnis’s sister, Amanda Kipnis, is a former athlete at the University of Maryland. Amanda played softball at Maryland but didn’t pursue the sport professionally.&nbsp;</p><p>Amanda graduated with a degree in Special Education from the University of Maryland and is now working at San Altos Elementary School.&nbsp;</p><p>At San Altos, Amanda works as the specialized academic instruction teacher for students in grades three to five.</p><p>She works with students with moderate to severe disabilities and, now and then, promotes new curriculums to help incorporate the students.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jason-kipnis-sister-amanda-kipnis.jpg><p>In 2020, Amanda <a href=# rel=noopener>talked about</a> i-Ready Reading and Mathematics, which she incorporated into her teaching and saw massive improvements.</p><p>Amanda might not have pursued softball professionally, but she hasn’t forgotten her roots. In her free time, she coaches softball and works on the project national non-profit, Girls On The Run.&nbsp;</p><p>The project inspires girls to recognize their abilities and strengths and work in a team environment. In 2020, Amanda was included in the Curriculum Associates Extraordinary Educators list.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking about her relationship with her brother, Amanda has been spotted attending her brothers’ games.</p><p>In 2016, when Cubs faced Guardians in the World Series Finals, Amanda wrote on Facebook that it was difficult for her Cubs-supporting family to root for the Guardians.&nbsp;</p><h2>Jason Kipnis Parents: Mark And Kay Kipnis</h2><p>Jason Kipnis’ parents, Mark and Kay Kipnis, once gifted the former MLB star a giant teddy bear for Christmas.</p><p>In 2015, Kipnis shared a photo of him holding the giant teddy bear and captioned the post saying that his parents were in a dilemma about what they should buy for him as the baseballer, with his salary, could buy anything he wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, his parents settled for the giant teddy bear, and looking at the pictures, Kipnis certainly loved it.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jason-kipnis-with-mother.jpg><p>Mark Kipnis, the father of four, went through years of legal proceedings after being charged with fraud at Hollinger International. He served as the general counsel when the allegations were made in 2007.</p><p>This led to Mark having his law license stripped. But in 2010, he was cleared of all the charges, and his law license was returned to him.&nbsp;</p><p>Jason said in an interview that seeing his family go through the difficult time made him work even harder. He has previously shared appreciation posts for his mother on Mother’s Day.</p><h3>Jason Kipnis Brothers: Blair And Todd Kipnis</h3><p>Jason Kipnis has two older brothers, Jason, and Todd Kipnis, who previously played high school baseball.</p><p>Unlike Jason, Blair has followed in their father’s footsteps. A graduate of the University of Michigan, Blair, after earning his degree in science, made his way to Loyola University Chicago School of Law.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/jason-kipnis-with-brothers.jpg><p>Blair is working as an associate attorney at Cunningham Meyes and Vedrine LLC and previously worked for Brennan Burtker.&nbsp;</p><p>Todd Kipnis graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder and later earned his master’s degree in sports from the University of Denver.</p><p>Since 2018, Jason has been operating Denver Art Glasses, a stained glass studio that opened in 1980.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCtzJqlnZldoLaxusisZKOZo6S7brfIqaWiq12otrTAxKtkqZmimru1v4yapZ1llpa6qrjYaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ayisha-diazs-boyfriend-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Ayisha Diaz Dating Ayisha Diaz's Boyfriend &amp;amp; Exes</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sinitta-net-worth-218014.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sinitta Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
