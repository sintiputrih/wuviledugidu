Also, his full name is <strong>Reginald Wayne.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Likewise, Wayne was raised by his parents, <strong>Ralph Wayne</strong> and <strong>Dennis Wayne</strong>. Not to mention, even his father is a former linebacker for Grambling State.</p><p>Guess we know where he got the inspiration for playing football. While growing up, Reggie was more interested in baseball and was a fan of the New Orleans Saints but chose football in the end.</p><p>Nonetheless, Reggie also has two other brothers with whom he grew up. As for his education, Wayne went to John Ehret High School and later attended the University of Miami.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, he is American by nationality, while his ethnic background is African-American.</p><h2>Early Career and Pre-NLF Days</h2><p>Before he chose football, Wayne was a huge baseball fan. We don’t know what went down his thought process, but he ultimately went with football and even started for the Hurricanes, the official team of the University of Miami.</p><p>During his college years, he set a record of 173 career catches and is one of the only five wide receivers in the school history to post 20 or more touchdowns in his career.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allen Iverson Bio: Career, NBA, 76ers, Wife, IG, Net Worth Wiki >></a></p><p>Likewise, his 48 receptions during the 1997 season set a school record for first-year students, which for your information, stands even today.</p><p>Besides football, Wayne also participated in track and field with a record of 21.87 seconds in the 200 meters.&nbsp;</p><h4>(Fun fact: Wayne was the roommate of Baltimore Ravens safety Ed Reed.)</h4><p>After spending four years at the Hurricanes,&nbsp; Wayne graduated from Miami University with a degree in liberal arts.</p><p>Reggie was inducted on March 24, 2011,&nbsp;into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame during their 43rd Annual Induction Banquet.</p><h2>Professional Career- Indianapolis Colts</h2><p>After his stellar career in high school and college, it was only a matter of time for Wayne to start his NFL career.</p><p>As predicted, the Indianapolis Colts picked Reggie in the 2001 NFL Draft, sixth of the 34 wide receivers. During his first year, he caught 27 passes and nine starts and missed three games due to his ankle injury.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Screenshot_1-300x217.png><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/reggie-wayne-career.1-255x300-1.jpg alt width=255 height=300 sizes="(max-width: 255px) 100vw, 255px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Wayne made up for his slow start the following year and doubled the numbers with 49 passes and four touchdowns.</p><p>This feat also continued for the following years, and he kept improving his records from the previous seasons. In a game against Green Bay, Reggie had four + yard games, including his personal best 194 yards on 11 receptions in Week 3.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, in 2005, Wayne had 1000+yards receiving and increased his reception total to 83.</p><p>In the playoffs, the American player had 97 yards, a two-point conversion, and a critical 22-yard reception but eventually lost to the champion, Pittsburgh Steelers.</p><p>Following the disappointing season, Wayne signed a six-year contract worth <strong>$39.5 million</strong>. In 2006, he broke the 100-yard mark not once but five times, including a season-best 134 yards and three touchdowns in Week 8 against Denver.</p><p>Not to mention, he caught 86 balls, a career-high along with 1,310 yards and nine touchdowns.</p><p>As a result, Wayne was selected for his very first Pro Bowl. 2007 proved challenging for Wayne as his teammates Harrison and Clark succumbed to injury.</p><p>Despite that, Reggie set a then-career-high in receptions and years as well.</p><p>Moreover, he also received 100 yards and a season-best 168 yards with a touchdown in Week 8 against Carolina.</p><p>Going to 2008, Reggie made it to Pro Bowl for three consecutive years and ended it with 82 catches, 1,145 yards, and six touchdowns.</p><p>It also included four 100+yard games, four touchdowns in the first five, and a 65-yard score.</p><h2>When did Reggie Wayne Retire? What is He Doing Now?</h2><p>During the Wild Card round, Reggie had 129 yards, including a 72-yard touchdown, but their team lost overtime.</p><p>However, in 2009, Reggie caught the winning touchdown pass with less than 20 seconds on the clock.</p><p>Even though he was selected for Pro Bowl again, Wayne could not play since the Colts were up for the Super Bowl. Sadly, the Colts lost to the New Orleans Saints 31-17.</p><p>After the 2010 season, Wayne set himself as the top receiver in the NFL. Not only did he cover 196 yards in Week 4, but he covered 200 yards in Week against Dallas.</p><p>But since he heavily relied on Peyton Manning to win games, without him, Reggie’s number got lower in 2011.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite that, Wayne still had four touchdown receptions and even recorded his 800th catch against the Pittsburgh Steelers.</p><p>Following the 2012 season, Reggie re-signed with the Colts for another three years.</p><p>Likewise, that year he earned the AFC Offensive Player of the Week award and broke <strong>Cris Carter</strong>‘s record of consecutive games with three or more receptions in just 59 games.</p><p>Also, from their game against the Baltimore Raves, Wayne had 114 yards on nine receptions and moved into second in career playoff catches with 92 but still lost the game.</p><p>On a positive note, Reggie got selected as the wide receiver for USA Football’s 2012 All-Fundamentals Team, which honors 26 NFL players each year for executing the fundamentals of their position.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Bonds Bio: Age, Career, Net Worth, MLB, Insta Wiki >></a></p><p>For the coming seasons, Wayne became more prone to injuries and had surgeries to repair them. By mid-2015, it was announced that the Colts would not be signing Wayne again, making him a free agent.</p><p>Looking at his credits and contributions to the past team, Reggie was immediately signed by the New England Patriots for a year. However, on September 5, 2015, he was released from the team upon his request.</p><p>Since he stayed still for the entire 2015 season, Wyane officially retired.</p><p>“It was fun, but it’s time. It’s just time. You know you’re done whenever you can admit that you’re done.”</p><p>He finished his NFL career tenth all-time in career receptions, tenth all-time in receiving yards, and 24th in career touchdown receptions. Since his retirement, Wayne joined the Colts as a volunteer receivers coach.</p><p>Furthermore, on November 18, 2018, the now-retired NFL player became the 15th player to be inducted into the team’s Ring of Honor, attended by his former teammates <strong><a href=#>Marvin Harrison</a>, Manning,</strong> and <strong>Saturday,</strong> to name a few.</p><h2>Reggie Wayne | Career Stats</h2><table class=wikitable><tbody><tr><th rowspan=2><strong>Year</strong></th><th rowspan=2><strong>Team</strong></th><th colspan=2><strong>Games</strong></th><th colspan=5><strong>Receiving</strong></th><th colspan=5><strong>Rushing</strong></th><th colspan=2><strong>Fumbles</strong></th></tr><tr><th>GP</th><th>GS</th><th>Rec</th><th>Yds</th><th>Avg</th><th>Lng</th><th>TD</th><th>Att</th><th>Yds</th><th>Avg</th><th>Lng</th><th>TD</th><th>Fum</th><th>Lost</th></tr><tr><th>2001</th><th>IND</th><td>13</td><td>9</td><td>27</td><td>345</td><td>12.8</td><td>43</td><td>0</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>2002</th><th>IND</th><td>16</td><td>7</td><td>49</td><td>716</td><td>14.6</td><td>49</td><td>4</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>2003</th><th>IND</th><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>68</td><td>838</td><td>12.3</td><td>57T</td><td>7</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>2004</th><th>IND</th><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>77</td><td>1,210</td><td>15.7</td><td>71T</td><td>12</td><td>1</td><td>-4</td><td>-4.0</td><td>-4</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>2005</th><th>IND</th><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>83</td><td>1,055</td><td>12.7</td><td>66T</td><td>5</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>2006</th><th>IND</th><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>86</td><td>1,310</td><td>15.2</td><td>51T</td><td>9</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>2007</th><th>IND</th><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>104</td><td>1,510</td><td>14.5</td><td>64</td><td>10</td><td>1</td><td>4</td><td>4.0</td><td>4</td><td>0</td><td>3</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><th>2008</th><th>IND</th><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>82</td><td>1,145</td><td>14.0</td><td>65T</td><td>6</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>2009</th><th>IND</th><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>100</td><td>1,264</td><td>12.6</td><td>65T</td><td>10</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>2010</th><th>IND</th><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>111</td><td>1,355</td><td>12.2</td><td>50</td><td>6</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>2011</th><th>IND</th><td>16</td><td>16</td><td>75</td><td>960</td><td>12.8</td><td>56T</td><td>4</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>2012</th><th>IND</th><td>16</td><td>15</td><td>106</td><td>1,355</td><td>12.8</td><td>33</td><td>5</td><td>1</td><td>-5</td><td>-5.0</td><td>-5</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th>2013</th><th>IND</th><td>7</td><td>7</td><td>38</td><td>503</td><td>13.2</td><td>35</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>5</td><td>5.0</td><td>5</td><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><th>2014</th><th>IND</th><td>15</td><td>15</td><td>64</td><td>779</td><td>12.2</td><td>80</td><td>2</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>–</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2>Career</th><th>211</th><th>197</th><th>1,070</th><th>14,345</th><th>13.4</th><th>80</th><th>82</th><th>4</th><th>0</th><th>0.0</th><th>5</th><th>0</th><th>10</th><th>7</th></tr></tbody></table><h2>Age and Body Measurements: How old is Reggie Wayne now?</h2><p>Reggie Wayne was active in the NFL as a professional footballer from 2001 to 2016.</p><p>He devoted over a decade as the Colts’ wide receiver and even now assists them as a coach for the same position.
