The actress continued, "I share her awkwardness; I can hardly walk like a regular person, I bump into everything and break things and spill and stumble."</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">She almost starred in Sofia Coppola's version of The Little Mermaid.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Disney continues to move ahead with its <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/a28291810/disney-the-little-mermaid-cast-ariel-halle-bailey/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="live-action version" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">live-action version</a> of the classic tale, but Maya was once in the running to play Ariel too.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2015, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/sofia-coppola-exits-the-little-mermaid-1201509589/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Variety class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Variety</a> reported that Sofia Coppola had dropped out of directing The Little Mermaid for Universal and Working Title after a disagreement regarding who should play the leading role. Apparently, Coppola was set on casting "newcomer Maya Thurman Hawke, the daughter of Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman, while studio brass were wary about the pick."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sadly, Coppola's version of the fairy tale never came to fruition, but having seen Maya act, it's easy to see why the director was set on her for the lead.</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">She changed her Stranger Things character.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In many ways, Maya was the breakout star of Stranger Things 3, joining the already-popular show and making a new character her own.

She continued, "Even when I go back and watch earlier episodes, it just seems like the most obvious decision ever."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It's impressive that the actress helped to influence her character on the Netflix series, despite having only just joined the show. As she said, "It was kind of a collaborative conversation, and I'm really, really happy with the way that it went."</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">She's a musician.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Maya is not only a talented actress; she's also a fledgling musician.
