She has his singers. She has his twisted inspiration etched into her songs. She has record producer Mike Dean. Tedros has been drained of all his purpose, leaving him a battered, lost, in-need-of-a-perm loser.</p><p>To deal a final cutting blow, co-manager Chaim does what any person trying to ruin another person would do — he weaponizes the media, this time in the form of Vanity Fair reporter Talia (Hari Nef), promising her a career-making story that’s designed to destroy Tedros forever.</p><p>But while Jocelyn may have read Tedros the riot act, it soon becomes clear that he’s not going anywhere — even if others, like the double-crossed Dyanne, her also-aspiring assistant, are.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The Weeknd has received backlash from critics and viewers for the show he created with Sam Levinson and Reza Fahim. <span class=credit>HBO</span></figure><p>One minute, Tedros is toast; the next Jocelyn is confessing to her audience —&nbsp;her “angels” —&nbsp;that success isn’t going to mean much without him. As she whispers to Tedros that he’s hers forever, we finally see her for what she is —&nbsp;a master manipulator, seemingly trained by the best. Also: Was Jocelyn ever actually abused by her mother, as she claimed?</p><p>And so, the problematic pair lie, twist and extort, all the way to the bitter end.</p><p>The short series has been beset by controversy, <a href=#>losing more than 100,000 viewers</a> following its premiere.</p><p>Its excessive and graphic displays of sex led Rolling Stone to <a href=#>describe the series as a “rape fantasy.”</a></p><p>British GQ gave the second episode the distinction of having the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“worst sex scene in history.”</a></p><p>Intimacy coordinator Marci Liroff, who did not work on “The Idol,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told Variety</a> she felt <a href=#>“betrayed” by HBO</a> after seeing the premiere episode, where a fictional intimacy coordinator gets locked in the bathroom so Jocelyn can show her nipples at an album cover shoot.</p><p>Liroff pointed out the eyebrow-raising reversal from the network that made a groundbreaking move in 2018 by hiring Alicia Rodis, the first intimacy coordinator for a major US production, for “The Deuce.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“The Idol” was projected to have six episodes, but a source claimed it “was never meant to be a long-running show,” wrapping after just five installments. <span class=credit>HBO</span></figure><p>Page Six previously <a href=#>reported that The Weeknd isn’t planning a second season</a> of “The Idol.”</p><p>“This was never meant to be a long-running show, it was always … a limited series,” a source said.</p><p>“It is being misreported that a decision on a second season of The Idol has been determined. It has not, and we look forward to sharing the next episode with you Sunday night,” HBO’s publicity arm said in a tweet.</p><p>There were also rumors that the first season had been cut short, with initial announcements promising six episodes.</p><p>However, <a href=#>TVLine reported</a> that a source said things changed “after Sam [Levinson] took over,” resulting in a story that only required five episodes.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">While critics and viewers criticized “The Idol,” some actors on set praised each other or the care they received. <span class=credit>HBO</span></figure><p>Levinson created HBO’s hit drama series “Euphoria,” another show circling around betrayal, sex, trauma and drugs.</p><p>Recently, an eyewitness <a href=#>exclusively told Page Six</a> the director ordered a “nonconsensual semen scene” shot for last Sunday’s episode, which did not make it to air.</p><p>Selena Gomez fans have recently been pointing out similarities between “The Idol” and the Disney-reared teen sensation. Gomez dated show co-creator and co-star Tesfaye briefly in 2017.</p><p>“Selena IS Jocelyn,” posited one <a href=#>TikTok user</a> in a video that toggles between scenes in “The Idol” and points in pop star Selena Gomez’s career around the time she was dating Tesfaye.</p><p>“Ever since finding out the idol is probably just the weeknd’s selena gomez fanfic i haven’t been able to sleep,” one user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a>.</p><p>“The Weeknd is a nasty person. The comparison between jocelyn and selena is scary and disrespectful. The idol lacks originality,” another <a href=#>sniped</a>.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">There is no announcement yet from HBO on if the series will be renewed for a second season. <span class=credit>HBO</span></figure><p>Amid controversy, support has come from the actors on set.</p><p>Depp <a href=#>praised The Weeknd</a> for melting into his role. Da’Vine Joy Randolph, who plays Jocelyn’s manager, also stood up for the singer when she <a href=#>told Variety</a> she <a href=#>trusted The Weeknd’s vision</a>.</p><p>The Weeknd, who said he <a href=#>expected the negative reaction</a> to “The Idol,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told GQ</a> the lack of “sexy” was intentional in creating the graphic, second-episode sex scene said to have been <a href=#>horrifying for viewers to watch</a>.</p><p>In an interview for Vogue Australia’s July cover story, Depp <a href=#>defended the show’s controversial scenes</a> as “important,” saying we “we live in a highly sexualized world.”</p><p>Against other claims about the safety on set, Depp told the outlet, “I’ve never felt more respected and more safe on a set, honestly.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3BmaWtfqbWmecidpqVllp67orjEZqOipKliv7C%2FxGabnqigqHqru8Keo7KmXaq7rbHArJ%2Beq12dsrN5z6iunqpf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pastor-john-lowe-ii-biography-age-wife-children-new-life-christian-church-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pastor John Lowe II Biography, age, wife, children, New Life Christian Church, net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lewis-hamilton-children.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lewis Hamilton Children: Does Lewis Hamilton Have Children?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
