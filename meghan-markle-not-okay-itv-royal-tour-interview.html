So, that was made really challenging. And, then when you have a newborn, and especially as a woman, it's a lot. So, you add this on top of just trying to be a new mom or trying to be a newlywed."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During her podcast appearance, Meghan revisited the emotional moment and explained, "Isn’t that funny, it was about a year ago that someone asked me that. We were on a tour in South Africa and on the last day of the tour, man I was tired. I was just about to give Archie a bath... I was exhausted."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prince Harry said of his wife, "She was still breastfeeding at the time," with Meghan explaining that she was feeding baby Archie between official royal engagements, and was extremely tired as a result.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Oh, yeah, so a lot of people don’t know, it’s like running a marathon, so between every official engagement I was running back to make sure our son was fed," Meghan said on the podcast. "And, yeah, it was a lot. But, at the very end, the journalist asked me, ‘Are you okay?’ And I didn’t realize that my answer would receive such an interest from around the world. Because I said well, thanks people haven’t really asked me if I’m okay. I didn't think about that answer. I just answered honestly because I was in a moment of vulnerability, because I was tired, because there was no presentation. It was just, here’s where I am, I’m a mom who’s with a four-and-a-half month old baby and we are tired. But I think it speaks to the fact that the reason it resonated with people is because everyone wants to be asked if they’re okay."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/32a17ebf-adab-48ef-a723-758c53a8bea8_1524066273.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" title="Headshot of Amy Mackelden" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Amy Mackelden is a freelance writer, editor, and disability activist.
