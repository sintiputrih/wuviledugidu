Among her credits are The Last Ship (2017), Nightflyers (2018), and Anne Boleyn (2021).</strong></p><p>The announcement comes as a number of stars say their final goodbyes to the show. Both Emma Mackey and Ncuti Trade in goods, who play Maeve Wiley and Eric, have confirmed that they will leave Sex Education after season 4. Many cast members left Laurie Nunn’s TV show before the fourth season began filming.</p><p>Olivia, Ola, Lily, and Emily Sands are played by Simone Ashley, Patricia Allison, Tanya Reynolds, and Rakhee Thakkar, respectively. Turner’s inclusion in Smith’s comes as welcome news to fans in the midst of the show’s cast turmoil. While neither the streaming service nor the show’s creators have confirmed the news, the actress hinted at her involvement in the show at the 2017 BAFTA Film Awards.</p><h2>Because of Ncuti Gatwa, Jodie Turner-Smith was cast in Sex Education</h2><p>While attending the BAFTA Film Awards on Sunday, February 19, 2023, in London, the actress revealed details about her role in the popular show.</p><p>Jodie Turner-Smith claims:</p><p><strong>“You might catch me on Netflix in a show called Sex Education.”</strong></p><p>When asked how it happened, she stated that the decision was driven by Ncuti Gatwa. Without giving too much away about her character, the actress revealed that she would be linked to Gatwa’s Eric.</p><p>Variety reports that the 36-year-old English actor added:</p><p><strong>“First and foremost, I spent all of my time with Ncuti Gatwa, who I DIE for and who is my favorite character on the show…</strong></p><p>So, when he called and asked me to do it, I said, “I don’t care how much they pay; I’m doing it.”</p><p>Her character, according to reports, will be Eric’s cousin and will be stationed in the United Kingdom, Nigeria, or Ghana. Turner-Smith is not the only new addition to the cast. The following are newcomers:</p><p>Dan Levy (Schitt’s Creek), Thaddea Graham (Curfew, Us), Marie Reuther (Kamikaze), and Felix Mufti are among the cast members.</p><p>Imani Yahshua, Alexandra James, and Anthony Lexa.</p><h2>Season 4 of Sex Education is all about</h2><p>Season 4 of the Netflix show has reportedly wrapped filming and is nearing completion, according to multiple sources. The streamer has not yet announced a release date for the fourth season, but it is expected to arrive in mid-2023. Season 4 of the fan-favorite series will “feature a blend of old and new interesting faces,” according to Variety.</p><p>In addition, graduates of Moordale Secondary School will seek “an alternate location to learn – and romp – after the school lost financing and was sold to developers.”</p><p>Turner-Smith will also appear in two television shows, Bad Monkey and The Acolyte, in addition to Sex Education. She will appear in Murder Mystery 2 alongside Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Actress</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Carrie Reichenbach</a></h3>Carrie Reichenbach estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
