Not only did the show run for a whopping 10 seasons, but it had one of the most recognized and talented casts ever -&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">without a doubt, that cast defined the 90s.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans instantly fell in love with the show, but more importantly with the characters! Whether you watch the show a million times a day or simply tune in whenever reruns pop up on your tv, there is no denying the magic that Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Chandler, Joey, and Ross brought to our lives.</p><p>The cast was extremely close to one another, however, it appears as if two of them were the closest! <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox </a>were said to have had the closest friendship both on and off-screen, and we can definitely see why. These two have since formed a beautiful friendship, and we are absolutely obsessed with them. Here is a rundown of facts about these twos friendship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-initially-auditioned-for-each-other-s-roles-on-friends><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>They Initially Auditioned For Each Other's Roles On "Friends"</span></h2><p>When the time came around for auditions to be held for Warner Brother's newest sitcom "Friends", it looks like our beloved cast members auditioned for different roles. Both Jennifer Aniston and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courteney Cox</a> auditioned for each other's roles in the show. Although we're certain they would have been able to pull it off, there was just something that didn't work. Luckily for us, Courteney didn't land the role of Rachel, and Jennifer didn't get Monica. Considering how great these two portrayed their characters, we're almost happy they didn't get each other's spots.</p><h2 id=they-ate-lunch-together-for-all-10-seasons-of-the-show><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>They Ate Lunch Together For All 10 Seasons Of The Show</span></h2><p>"Friends" is without a doubt one of the most successful sitcoms to date! Not only was the cast incredible on-screen, but they were the best of friends off-screen too. The ladies of the show, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox and Lisa Kudrow always ate lunch together every single day</a>. The trio would enjoy their salads from the same restaurant every week and enjoy their time together in between scenes. While they don't see each other every day like they used to, they definitely keep in touch and see one another as often as they all can.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-instantly-became-real-life-besties><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Instantly Became Real-Life Besties</span></h2><p>During the pilot episode of "Friends", we see Monica and Rachel rekindle their friendship after a soaking wet Rachel runs into Central Perk after having ditched her wedding. While the two became besties in the first episode, the same can be said for them in real life. Both Courteney and Jennifer instantly hit it off, and considering most of their scenes were together, they got really close really fast.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">14 Pics Of Jennifer Aniston & Courteney Cox Showing Their True Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=they-helped-one-another-through-their-divorces><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>They Helped One Another Through Their Divorces</span></h2><p>When it comes to your best girlfriend, you know that they are always there for you, and that was the exact case for Jennifer and Courteney. The two both married a year apart from one another, and despite them being in what appears to be happy marries, both Jen and Courteney experience divorces. Aniston had her separation from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad Pitt</a> happen during the final season of "Friends", and Cox and David Arquette split back in 2013. It is safe to say that these two were definitely one another's support systems and ensured they were there for each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-is-the-godmother-to-courteney-s-daughter><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jennifer Is The Godmother To Courteney's Daughter</span></h2><p>During the final seasons of "Friends" Monica and Chandler were experience infertility issues, hence why the went down the adoption route. While that storyline is a known fact, many fans of the show don't know that Courteney ended up getting pregnant in real life during the final season. Since her character was not able to get pregnant, she had to hife her pregnancy during the filming of the show. Only a few months after wrapping up did she give birth to her first child, Coco. Considering how close she and Jennifer are, it was no surprise when the two revealed that Aniston would serve as Coco's godmother.</p><h2 id=they-were-also-each-others-maids-of-honour><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>They Were Also Each Others Maids Of Honour</span></h2><p>In addition to being godmothers and one another's support system, these two also served as one another maid of honours, both in real life and on "Friends". Courteney Cox was the first of the bunch to walk down the aisle in 1999 and Aniston a year later. The two had only been working together for 5 years at the time, but that was enough for them to feel comfortable enough to have them by their side at their weddings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything There Is To Know About Jennifer Aniston & Courteney Cox' Friendship</a></span></p><h2 id=they-think-a-lot-alike><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>They Think A Lot Alike</span></h2><p>When it comes to Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox, it appears they are more alike than we think. While they may have taken this photo for a few giggles, it turns out that they don't stray away from similar styles. The two have spent nearly 30 years as friends, so it would only make sense for both Jen and Courteney to adopt one another's style, and we certainly aren't complaining one bit about it.</p><h2 id=they-spend-thanksgiving-together><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Spend Thanksgiving Together</span></h2><p>Just when you thought these two could not spend any more time together, they've got holidays on lockdown too! Courteney Cox hosts Thanksgiving every year where she invited her family and closest friends, so you bet Jennifer Aniston is always in attendance. The duo celebrated needless turkey murder day; bonus points to anyone who gets that reference and spiced things up by making enchiladas for their close friend, Jimmy Kimmel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-invited-courteney-to-her-honeymoon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jennifer Invited Courteney To Her Honeymoon</span></h2><p>Jennifer Aniston's second marriage to Justin Theroux was one for the books! The two got married back in 2015 and not only did Courteney Cox step in as Jennifer's maid of honour, but she also got an invite to the honeymoon. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aniston and Theroux decided to invite along their closest friends to their honeymoon</a> instead of keeping it as the two of them. While this may sound strange, the two decided for a more modern approach rather than the traditional type of honeymoon we are all used to.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courteney Cox Might Hold Secrets About Brad Pitt & Jennifer Aniston</a></span></p><h2 id=all-the-friends-ladies-have-a-group-chat><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>All The "Friends" Ladies Have A Group Chat</span></h2><p>As mentioned, Jennifer, Courteney and Lisa Kudrow, who played Phoebe Buffay on "Friends", had lunch with one another every single day. In addition to a ladies' lunch, they also have their very own group chat. All three women have talked about how they keep in touch with one another and revealed that they all communicate via the group chat the three of them have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-were-the-closest-of-the-friends-cast><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Were The Closest Of The "Friends" Cast</span></h2><p>While the cast of "Friends" was made up of six of the best people, it appears as if others were closer to each other than some. In this case, it has been made clear that Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston had a much closer relationship with one another than with the rest of the cast. Despite having a closer friendship, the two still bonded with the others and remain class to all of them to this day.</p><h2 id=they-will-soon-star-in-a-friends-reunion><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>They Will Soon Star In A "Friends" Reunion</span></h2><p>Speaking of remaining close to one another, the cast of "Friends" have not only kept in touch after all these years, but they will be officially reuniting! While the reunion was set to take place this month, it appears we're going to have to wait a little bit longer for the HBO Max special. While the gang won't be playing their characters, fans can ready for an "unscripted-style" reunion where they will all most likely take a stroll through memory lane.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here Is What's Going To Happen To The Friends Reunion Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7bq%2FOrqmtnZ6axm6vzrFkn6qZmrulv8eip2aekZjBtHnFq6CeppSoerOtwqGcpWWdpLuqr8Bo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./patrick-rothfuss-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-421750-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Patrick Rothfuss Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./evee-bennett-net-worth-328834.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Evee Bennett Net Worth 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
