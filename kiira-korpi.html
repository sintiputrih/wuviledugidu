She was assigned to the 2015 Trophée Éric Bompard, but withdrew from the event. On 27 August 2015, she announced her retirement from competitive skating at a press conference in Helsinki. In a later interview, she stated that she had been struggling with anxiety. She also said, "Every time I started training, I got injured. I was mentally very empty. I took time for myself to think about what I need to do. I knew that I cannot continue competing."</p><p>Korpi made her return to competition at the 2014 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb after a two-year hiatus due to injuries. She finished 4th in the short but moved up in the free skate to win the event. She won her fifth national title in December. She competed at the 2015 European Championships in Stockholm, placing fourth in the short program. However, Korpi withdrew from the competition before the free skate citing illness. She placed 31st at the 2015 World Championships.</p><p>On 23 August 2013, Korpi confirmed a coaching change to <a href=#>Rafael Arutyunyan</a> in Lake Arrowhead, California. She was assigned to two Grand Prix events, the 2013 Skate Canada International and the 2013 Trophee Eric Bompard, but had to withdraw from both due to an Achilles tendon injury sustained in September.

Her next event was Finnish nationals, which she won for the second time in her career. Korpi won the bronze medal at the 2011 European Championships.</p><p>Korpi did not participate in the Grand Prix series.

At the 2008 Worlds, she was 4th after the short program but had a poor long program and ended up in ninth place.</p><p>Competing in the JGP series, Korpi placed 7th in Slovakia and won the bronze medal in Estonia. After taking the bronze medal at the 2006 Finnish Championships, she was assigned to the 2006 European Championships, which the Finnish skating federation had decided to use to determine the Olympic team. Korpi's European result, 6th, allowed her to compete at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, where she finished 16th.</p><p>In the 2006–07 season, Korpi made her senior Grand Prix debut. She placed 4th at the 2007 Finnish Nationals, then went to the 2007 European Championships and won the bronze medal, making her the second Finnish ladies' singles skater to ever win a European medal.

She received a host wildcard spot at the JGP Final, where she finished fourth.

The following season, making her ISU Junior Grand Prix (JGP) debut, she placed 6th in Slovenia and took the bronze medal in Poland.
