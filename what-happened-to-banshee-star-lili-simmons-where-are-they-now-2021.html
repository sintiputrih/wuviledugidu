This is especially true of Disney stars. For years, fans were wondering <a href=#>what happened to Cory In The House's Madison Pettis</a>. But it's more mainstream actors too, like <a href=#>X-Men's Famke Jensen</a>, who was once a major celebrity and then seemingly disappeared. Of course, Julia Stiles is perhaps the celebrity that fans most wonder about. After all, she has been featured in numerous movies, such as the Bourne films, and TV shows like Dexter and yet <a href=#>nobody hears from her anymore</a>. But you can't exactly say that for Lili Simmons. Her career has just taken a slightly different turn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, FX fans are well aware of who Lili Simmons is. She often stole entire episodes of Banshee with just a bat of her doe-like eyes. The undeniably beautiful star was also able to show off a wide range of acting chops playing Rebecca Bowman, a not so innocent Amish girl turned murderer-businesswoman. While Lili was heavily featured on the action-packed small-town show for all four seasons, fans are wondering why she hasn't been in the public eye since. The truth is, she has, just in smaller roles.</p><h2 id=lili-39-s-career-is-actually-extremely-impressive>Lili's Career Is Actually Extremely Impressive</h2><p>Even though Lili hasn't yet earned a role as large as the one she had on Banshee, she actually has been cast in some of the highest-profile projects on television. The California-born actor has come a long way since the start of her career. Not surprisingly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lili began her career</a> as a model under The Ford Modeling Agency. But by 2010, she was already getting cast in web series and even made it onto the Disney Channel movie Geek Charming. From there she was steadily cast in very small roles until getting her big break in 2013... That was Banshee, of course.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After her impressive arc playing Rebecca Bowman, Lili was hired to play a prostitute who was pivotal to the investigation in the acclaimed first season of True Detective. Her character also entered into an affair with Woody Harrelson's Marty and eventually blew up his marriage.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Ray Donovan': The Cast Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>After True Detective, Lili was cast in a recurring role in the remake of the hit network police procedural Hawaii Five-O. She was also hired in three smaller movies; one with Kurt Russell called Bone Tomahawk, a mystery thriller called Bad Match, and Dirty Lies with AJ Michalka and Scout Taylor-Compton.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These films were followed by her being cast in two of the most beloved shows on TV, Westworld, and Ray Donovan. In the case of the HBO sci-fi thriller, Lili's character was actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">supposed to be featured in multiple episodes</a> of the show but only appeared in one episode in the first season and one episode in the second. There's no word if her character 'New Clementine' will ever appear again on the show as it moves into its fourth season. Although, given the show's change of scenery, it seems highly unlikely that it ever will.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Really Happened To Alton Brown After 'Iron Chef: America'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Ray Donovan, Lili had a much more substantial part as Natalie James, a movie star who gets involved with the main character for eight episodes of the season that aired in 2017. In 2018, she got another eight-episode arc on the TV version of The Purge and was even cast as the older version of Selina Kyle (AKA Catwoman) in the series finale of Gotham. But after that, Lili did seem to fall off the face of the Earth.</p><p>For someone with such incredible roles under her belt, it's sad that she's only got an upcoming small indie film and a Starz TV show on her IMDb. However, given Lili's immense level of talent, it's likely that she will rebound as she did after Banshee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About What Happened To Lou Bega</a></span></p><h2 id=what-else-is-lili-doing-with-her-time>What Else Is Lili Doing With Her Time</h2><p>Lili isn't exactly in the mainstream so we know very little about her private life. However, she does post a lot on her Instagram and we've gathered a bit of information from that. For one, Lili is incredibly close with her Banshee co-star Ivana Milicevic. The two of them have spent a lot of time together and even vacationed in Portugal this past summer.</p><p>Vacationing seems to be something very important to Lili as she's been seen traveling all around the world and has been spending quite a bit of time in Paris, France. Perhaps she's doing a bit of modeling there?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lili also keeps her love life very under wraps, but for a while, she was dating one of her other Banshee co-stars, Tom Pelphrey. Not only did Lili feature PDA-filled photos of her and Tom on her Instagram but they also p<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ublicly flirted on Twitter</a>. However, their relationship did end at some point as Tom has been romantically linked to another woman.</p><p>Even though very little is known about Lili's private life, we're sure that we'll learn a lot more as she continues to grow her career and becomes the massive star that she deserves to become.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>This Is What Really Happened To Dylan O'Brien's Ex-Girlfriend, Britt Robertson</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhksKCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGLBsHnBmqWsoJWaerTAwKtkpaGcnnq0tcympqerXay1pr7EZpirnV2ptabFjKemsGViZX9yew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./call-the-midwife-helen-george-cute-photos-new-baby-lark.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>9 cute photos of Helen George's baby girl Lark with co-star Jack Ashton</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./phalisia-boothe-age-wife-daughter-squid-game-player-229.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Phalisia Boothe Age, Wife, Daughter, Squid Game Player 229</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
