I reacted in a very poised way. First of all, I made sure it would run in the club because that's more painful than anything. As opposed to just being on a blog, I wanted to be on a record that you would have to stand around and hear every night for a few months. That was my whole strategy going into that. Instead of sounding hurt and malicious, I wanted to sound fun, get my shit off. Like I said, if it happens again, not that I want it, not that I welcome it, but I'm ready. I really enjoy writing bars, man. I'm not nervous about anybody saying anything to me.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>It seemed like you won, but his last line was good.</strong>&nbsp;<br>The Canada Dry line? That was epic. I liked it. It wasn't a good line necessarily, but it was funny.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Did he step over the line when he scorned you for being biracial?</strong><br>For you to delve into my mom and my dad's a bitch and all that, you're just reaching for impact moments but the bars aren't really good so it didn't hit me. I never sat back and analyzed that either. I only heard it once, and thought, "I think I came away with the W on that one."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdhaYR2f4ydqZqjlWLAosXSZp%2BeZaeku260yKxkm5mkqbmmedaiq6Flk6S6rrvNZqWer6M%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rhocs-kelly-dodd-slams-rick-leventhals-ex-fiancee-lauren-sivan.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>RHOC's Kelly Dodd Slams Rick Leventhals Ex-Fiancee Lauren Sivan</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-rippling-muscle-disease-jo-lindners-rare-condition-explained-as-popular-bodybuilder-dies-aged-30-653828-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is rippling muscle disease?
