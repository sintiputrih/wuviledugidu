In addition to Carli, her brother Michael, and her sister, Amanda, Stephen left behind his younger sisters, his mother, and several nieces and nephews. He was also dating a woman named Judy at the time of his passing.</p><p>It's unclear if Stephen and Carli's mother, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jodi</a>, kept in touch, but according to Guru Gossiper, it seems like they may have had some serious <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discrepancies regarding child support</a> amid their divorce. Carli and her mom, however, are quite close, and they often appear on each other's social media channels. Hopefully, Jodi is Carli's rock right now.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Stephen Bybel will be greatly missed by his friends and family.
