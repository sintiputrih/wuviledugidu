They were married in 1973 and divorced in 1982. She also had a relationship with Ryan O’Neal whom she had a son with. They were first linked to each other in 1979, about five years after his divorce from Leigh Taylor-Young, his second wife.</p><p>Their relationship was off-and-on for over three decades until Farrah’s death in 2009.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Farrah Fawcett career</h2><p>With a prominent performance in the first season of Charlie’s Angels, Fawcett became an international celebrity. She is a six-time Golden Globe Award contender and a four-time Primetime Emmy Award candidate.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/09214303/gettyimages-88708767-612x612-1.jpg><p>In the 1960s, Fawcett started her career making appearances in television guest spots and commercials. She made frequent appearances on television shows throughout the 1970s, including Harry O (1974–1976) and The Six Million Dollar Man (1974–1978), when she co-starred with her then-husband, film and television star Lee Majors. Six million copies of her famous red swimsuit poster were sold in its first year of publication.</p><p>Charlie’s Angels, starring Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith, included Fawcett in the role of private investigator Jill Munroe, which proved to be her breakout role. All three actresses became well-known thanks to the show.</p><p>Fawcett chose to leave Charlie’s Angels in 1976, following her appearance in the first season of the show. She later made a comeback to the show, appearing in six episodes as a guest star in the third and fourth seasons (1978–1980). Fawcett was nominated for a Golden Globe for the first time for her performance in Charlie’s Angels.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Fawcett’s performance in the Off-Broadway play Extremities in 1983 drew favorable reviews.

Despite facing considerable backlash for her meandering appearance on The Late Show with David Letterman in 1997, Fawcett received positive reviews for her performance in Robert Duvall’s film The Apostle that same year.</p><p>She kept performing on television in the twenty-first century, landing recurring parts in the drama The Guardian (2002–2003) and the sitcom Spin City (2001). She was nominated for a third Emmy for the latter.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/09214053/Ryan-ONeal-and-Farrah-Fawcett-120823-5-59fa745691244becb7ded0a8c19927f0-1024x683.jpg><p>Love Is a Funny Thing (1969), Logan’s Run (1976), Myra Breckinridge (1970), Sunburn (1979), Saturn 3 (1980), The Cannonball Run (1981), Extremities (1986), The Apostle (1997), and Dr. T & the Women (2000) are just a few of the films in which Fawcett has appeared.</p><p><strong>Source: <a href=# rel=noopener>www.Ghgossip.com</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTGqKqsoaBjsLC5jp%2BYq6qRnXqnrdacnK2sXZ3CtK7Ap5to</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jason-cantu-bio-age-family-job-married-street-outlaws.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Jason Cantu!
