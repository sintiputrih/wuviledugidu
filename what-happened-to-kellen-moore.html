The NFL Network reported the news, and it came as a surprise to many fans and analysts who thought Moore would remain in the position for the foreseeable future. Moore had been with the Cowboys since 2018, serving as the offensive coordinator from 2019-2022. His final game as OC was a playoff loss to the San Francisco 49ers.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Cowboys had the 11th-ranked offense this season, but they struggled with turnovers. Quarterback Dak Prescott had a career-worst 15 interceptions, which may have contributed to Moore's departure. Despite the team's offensive struggles, Moore was still considered a rising star in the coaching world. The 33-year-old had been mentioned as a potential head coaching candidate for several teams in the future.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Moore's departure leaves a void in the Cowboys' coaching staff, but defensive coordinator Dan Quinn will remain with the team for at least another season. The Cowboys will need to find a new offensive coordinator to replace Moore, and the search may take some time. However, the team has some promising young players on offense, including Prescott, running back Ezekiel Elliott, and wide receiver CeeDee Lamb. The new coordinator will have a lot of talent to work with and will need to find a way to maximize their potential.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>This is not the first time Moore has made headlines for his departure from the Cowboys. In 2016, Moore suffered a broken ankle during practice and required surgery. Head coach Jason Garrett confirmed the surgery went well but stated that Moore would be out for "a while." The injury created a lack of depth behind starting quarterback Tony Romo, and the Cowboys needed to sign someone to back him up. The team had third-string quarterback Jameill Showers and rookie Dak Prescott, but it was unlikely either player would be ready to play immediately. The early timing of Moore's injury allowed the Cowboys to acclimate a new quarterback to their system before the regular season began.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Moore's injury in 2016 may have been a factor in his decision to become a coach. He had been a backup quarterback for the Cowboys and Detroit Lions but never played a significant role on the field. However, Moore was known for his football IQ and was highly respected by his teammates and coaches. He was often praised for his work ethic and dedication to the game.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Moore's departure from the Cowboys may not be the end of his coaching career. He has already been mentioned as a potential candidate for several head coaching jobs, including the Boise State Broncos, where he played college football. Moore was one of the most successful quarterbacks in college football history, setting several records during his time at Boise State. He was also a finalist for the Heisman Trophy in 2010 and 2011.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Moore's success as a quarterback at the college level has translated into success as a coach. He helped lead the Cowboys to a top-ranked offense in 2019 and was praised for his work with Prescott. The quarterback had one of his best seasons under Moore's guidance, throwing for over 4,900 yards and 30 touchdowns.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Kellen Moore's departure from the Dallas Cowboys was a mutual decision between him and the organization. The team will need to find a new offensive coordinator to replace Moore, but they have a lot of talent on offense to work with. Moore's success as a coach may lead to more opportunities in the future, and he has already been mentioned as a potential head coaching candidate for several teams.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0midmqZdlr%2BktI6wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkeqyxy6Wcp2WdpLyzsQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./eddie-deezen.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Eddie Deezen</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./roc-herpich-wiki-salary-married-wedding-spouse-family.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Roc Herpich Wiki: Salary, Married, Wedding, Spouse, Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
