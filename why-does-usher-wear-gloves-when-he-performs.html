And yet, the most intriguing part about Usher’s acclaimed presentation was his utilization of leather gloves, which earned him the “king of unnecessary gloves” label.</p><p data-characters=279 data-current-count=279 data-injectable=false>Throughout the 15-minute performance, the R&B star donned several pairs of stylish gloves — all of which caught the attention of viewers all around the world who were watching.

After collaborating with Alicia Keys, Usher eventually switched to a blue and black outfit while roller skating, with black leather gloves on display.</p><h2 id=h-so-why-does-usher-wear-gloves-when-he-performs data-injectable=false>So, why does Usher wear gloves when he performs?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=622 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Uhhh what’s with the gloves Usher??? <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/KHPISnjYRv</a></p>— Nate (@AchillesMoto) <a href=#>February 11, 2024</a></figure><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>Believe it or not, no official answer has been given as to why Usher wears gloves when he performs — especially when you consider the fact that Usher has been wearing gloves when he performs since the ‘90s, when he first had his breakthrough as a credible music artist. From there, the singer has worn gloves in the 2000s and 2010s as well, including wearing them during certain interviews.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=782 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One theory</a> about Usher wearing gloves refers to the performer wearing them to honor Michael Jackson as a tribute — specifically a pair of white gloves, which Jackson made famous throughout his career. This theory hasn’t been confirmed, of course, but seeing as Jackson is a notable influence and inspiration for many artists, it certainly wouldn’t be too difficult to believe.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=441 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=false>Another theory points at Usher perhaps having a certain health concern or germaphobia, thus why he would wear the gloves to either protect himself or others. Then again, one could argue that he simply wears gloves as a fashion statement to enhance the appearance of his outfits and costumes while singing and dancing. Either way, wearing gloves has become an essential part of Usher’s performances that add an extra article of accessories.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqcWMnaaeq12qwKmx0WaunpmiYrStu9WeqmavmJq7brTEZqeeqpakv66%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./behzinga-shared-a-daughter-olive-ottilie-payne-with-girlfriend-faith-kelly-505549-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Behzinga Shared A Daughter Olive Ottilie Payne With Girlfriend Faith Kelly</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./too-turnt-tony-height-how-tall-is-too-turnt-tony-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Too Turnt Tony Height | How Tall is Too Turnt Tony?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
