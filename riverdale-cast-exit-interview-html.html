In this world, adapted by showrunner and executive producer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, Archie Andrews (<a href=#>KJ Apa</a>) fucked — and he wasn’t just in a love triangle with Betty Cooper (<a href=#>Lili Reinhart</a>) and Veronica Lodge (<a href=#>Camila Mendes</a>); he was being groomed by Miss Grundy.

The show was weird from the start, but around season three, <a href=#>the writers upped the ante</a> with an organ-harvesting cult and evil nuns and an alien abduction and superpowers. Riverdale took tropes from gothic horror, fantasy, telenovelas, soap operas, comic books, gay art-house films, dark high-school comedies, musicals, and mafia movies and smushed them together into a pop-culture polycule — while the ensemble held it all together, putting it on like some sort of weekly vaudeville act.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllbaw270001j3b6x09t78w4i@published data-word-count=100>The show ends August 23 as one of the last of its kind: the 22-episodes-a-season teen soap.

Once, I was at the airport going through TSA, and this guy in his 50s was like, “Hey, you’re that guy from Riverdale.” He was Caucasian, and his wife was Chinese, and their son was mixed like me. I remember introducing myself to him and his mom saying, “See, he looks like you! He’s an actor.” That was a good feeling.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllbaw6ad002s3b6xhhpkmxzg@published data-word-count=147><strong>Tanner: </strong>When I started acting in Vancouver around 2010 to 2016, to be racially ambiguous was the thing because you could read for any type of character that they couldn’t find. But I think right around when the show started airing, it moved away from “Let’s find racially ambiguous people” to “Let’s actually find people that have roots in these cultures and these ethnicities.” I’ve never really publicly come out and said what my ethnicity is, so there was a fear there for me. I don’t want to be defined by my ethnicity. So then to be brought onto a show like Riverdale that says, “We’re not going to define you by your ethnicity,” but where we also had an episode where we touched on sundown towns and I was able to embrace that part of my background and tell that story, meant a lot to me.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllbaw6cp002t3b6xebwtjizs@published data-word-count=111><strong>This is also a show where every young character is sexualized. It’s a given for the genre, but it’s transgressive because of the source material.</strong><strong><br></strong><strong>Petsch:</strong> Being in a female-female relationship on the show was interesting because Vanessa and I were the biggest supporters of having more sexual encounters on the show. And I feel like some people were scared of that. In season three, she and I just decided with a director to put in this sex scene that wasn’t there. And that, I think, broke the barrier of allowing us to be more like the other couples on the show. I felt it was really important for our particular relationship.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllbaw6f1002u3b6x9t3x6dyn@published data-word-count=106><strong>And Riverdale has an equal-opportunity gaze. The sexualization doesn’t just affect the women.</strong><br><strong>Apa: </strong>I’ve been through a lot of shit with that. It can mess with your head a little bit. At first, as a young child, which is what I was, I thought it was cool — you almost want the opportunity to be shirtless. I was like, “Yeah, let me take my shirt off. Boom!” And then you gotta consistently stay in incredible shape. It takes a toll. Even saying that I didn’t feel comfortable I had a hard time with. I thought people would be like, “Why not? Just fucking do it, bro.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllbaw6hg002v3b6x9m2xwmee@published data-word-count=37><strong>Petsch: </strong>The other day, I had to do a lingerie shoot and I felt so shitty about my body I cried.

My body does not look like that anymore. And suddenly this season we’re 17 again. I’ve looked at myself in the mirror and laughed at myself a couple of times. I don’t look like I’m 17, and I’m okay with that! But it’s this weird feeling, like you have to fit yourself back into this box that you presented to the world when we first stepped into these characters. Just being an actor in general, you feel like you’re holding yourself to a consistent standard of I must not age, and I must continue to look like I did.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cllbaw6qa002x3b6xoe48oby7@published data-word-count=30><strong>Mendes:</strong> We need to say Roberto is always very understanding of us, and there’s nobody forcing us to do anything.
