She revealed in an interview that they both fell in love while making <strong>Senorita. </strong>The track, which is nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 2020 Grammy Awards, is the pair’s second collaboration, following 2015’s “I Know What You Did Last Summer.”</p><p>According to Cabello, it was while working on that first duet that she and Mendes felt a spark between them, saying, “During ‘I Know What You Did Last Summer,’ I really bonded with him as more than a friend.” While she believes the feeling was mutual, Cabello said it wasn’t the right time for them to pursue a relationship because “we were both really young, and he was experiencing the pressures of his career.”</p><p>“I don’t think we knew what to do with those feelings,” she continued. “It was this awkward thing where we both liked each other, but we weren’t together. It was just weird.” After that, Cabello and Mendes spent some time apart, in which she reportedly dated Matthew Hussey and he was linked to Hailey Bieber, but once they were back in the studio again, they were able to rekindle their relationship.</p><p>Though Mendes hasn’t been quite as forthcoming about the circumstances that inspired his relationship with Cabello, the singer did tell fans in October that they started dating on the Fourth of July. “Honestly, I wanna say I wanna talk to you guys about this stuff, but it’s not just me in the relationship,” he told fans a month earlier about his and Cabello’s decision to keep their rekindled romance under the radar, per Elle. “There’s another person involved and I can’t say things that I feel. It’s not just me deciding you know?”</p><p>And while the Rolling Stone interview is the first time that Cabello has explicitly mentioned Mendes by name, she did tell Elle in October that “this past year and a half was the first time I really experienced falling in love with another person.” Explaining that their love inspired much of her upcoming sophomore album, Romance, Cabello continued, “I think there is so much more depth to love when you know you are in it with another person. You have so much more to say I think that’s what makes me emotional.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shawn-mendes-stitches></span><span>Shawn Mendes Stitches</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shawn scored his first-ever Top 20 hit on the Hot 100 charts as his single <strong>“Stitches”. </strong>The teen singer-songwriter spoke to Billboard about the song on the red MTV Video Music Awards red carpet, saying that the Handwritten single is a good indication of what’s to come on his next full-length.</p><p>The song was written by Daniel Parker, Teddy Geiger, and Daniel Kyriakides.&nbsp; Daniel Parker described the songwriting session as a “blind date” set up by Big Deal Music. He recalled that he had written down the word “Stitches” on his phone, but he didn’t know where he wanted to use it.</p><p>He admitted that he is constantly writing down words, titles, and concepts. He brought in the word for Teddy Geiger and came up with the line “Now without your kisses, I’ll be needing stitches.” They immediately came up with a melody for the chorus, and the song was refined.</p><p>Parker focused on the top line and sculpted the concept. The producer Daniel “Daylight” Kyriakides joined on the second day of writing. “Daylight” developed the track, and they laid down acoustic guitar and bass sounds.</p><p>Shawn Mendes usually counts on his songwriting abilities, so he wasn’t sure about recording the song that he hadn’t composed himself. Mendes explained, “I was thinking, I don’t want to sing because I only want to sing songs that I write. I was like, ‘Well, let me just listen to this,’ and I fell in love. It was just so cool to hear that.”</p><p>Shawn remembered that before he heard it, he wanted to write a song where the bridge is repetitive, and just drills itself into the head, “When that bridge hit, I was like, ‘This is the song.’ I had to have it.”</p><p>The song slowly ascended to the top spot on the UK singles chart in its 17th week. It was the first song by Shawn Mendes to reach the peak position in the UK.&nbsp; “Stitches” won the award for the best single at BBC Radio 1 Teen Awards on October 23, 2016.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shawn-mendes-treat-you-better></span><span>Shawn Mendes Treat You Better</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shawn’s treat you better is an archetypal entry into the genre of jealousy songs, but its video takes his message one step further. In the video, Mendes pines over a girl who’s stuck in an abusive relationship with another guy. Even though her boyfriend throws her around when they fight, she sticks with him much to the dismay of Mendes, who’s hoping to be with her instead and hits a few walls about it.</p><p>The dramatic video ends by displaying the number for the National Domestic Violence Hotline, implicitly encouraging anyone who’s in an abusive relationship (or knows someone who is) to seek out help.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shawn-mendes-tours></span><span>Shawn Mendes Tours</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mendes has been to many tours where he was either headlining,co-headlining or Opening act.</p><p><strong>Headlining</strong></p><ul><li>ShawnsFirstHeadlines (2014–15)</li><li>Shawn Mendes World Tour (2016)</li><li>Illuminate World Tour (2017)</li></ul><p><strong>Co-headlining</strong></p><ul><li>Jingle Ball Tour 2014 (with various artists) (2014)</li><li>Jingle Ball Tour 2015 (with various artists) (2015)</li></ul><p><strong>Opening act</strong></p><ul><li>Austin Mahone: Live on Tour (Austin Mahone) (North America) (2014)</li><li>The 1989 World Tour (Taylor Swift) (North America) (2015)</li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=shawn-mendes-awards-and-nominations></span><span>Shawn Mendes Awards and Nominations</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mendes has received several awards and nominations, including two MTV Europe Music Awards, four iHeartRadio Much Music Video Awards, and the Allan Slaight Honour from Canada’s Walk of Fame.</p><p>In 2015, Mendes was the recipient of the Breakout Award at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto.
