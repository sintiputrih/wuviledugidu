I like to preach, but I don’t always practice what I preach.”</p><p>And rather than rely on her team to craft no-makeup makeup looks for her in the film that could conceal any imperfections, Mother Monster apparently dove headfirst into Ally’s world and rocked a bare face on screen.</p><p>Her longtime esthetician, Joomee Song of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Faceworks Inc.</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Refinery29</a> that the Oscar-winner “had no makeup on” and instead relied on Song’s facial massage and skincare techniques to keep her complexion camera-ready.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Lady-Gaga-not-wearing-makeup-in-A-Star-Is-Born-02.jpg><p>“If she was going to have close-ups, I would do a scrub with hyaluronic acid or something that would help reduce redness, because she would have to go on camera immediately after [I saw her],” she shared. “Instead of acids or granules, I use a piece of gauze as a physical exfoliant and hydrating emollient products to get her glow. Your skin already has the ability to shed its dead skin cells and my goal is to support what your skin can do. So, I massage in a brightening serum and then literally scrape it off with the gauze.”</p><p>Additionally, she used her Kaika massage method that “stimulates blood flow, releases tension and reduces water retention.” It involves a combination of her fingers and a Japanese microcurrent machine to de-puff, reduce dark circles and contour for a “tighter and brighter” effect.</p><p>Song said she began working with Gaga in the lead-up to her appearance at the 2014 Oscars, and she’s been a part of her glam squad (which also includes mane man <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frederic Aspiras</a> and makeup artist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sarah Tanno</a>) ever since. “I worked on her skin for her Sound of Music performance at the 2015 Oscars, American Horror Story, A Star is Born&nbsp;and more,” she explained.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While the musician and actress has certainly been known for her avant-garde beauty looks over the years, fans have long admired her #flawless skin. And while Song said she has a less is more approach to skincare, there are a few products she’s turned Gaga on to.</p><p>“I don’t use a lot of product at all on her. In general, I do love using <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">May Lindstrom</a> products,” she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Refinery29</a>. “Before a red carpet, I like to use <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmetics 27’s Plasma 27 Mask</a>. It’s formulated with plant stem cells … for calming inflammation and brightening skin.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6GupcWMoJigmaNiwKy1zWaqnpuimsG0ecWoqWalkaCytryMn6menV2WerTAwKtkoqtdl7yzuoysmp6mlah6pbHTmqClq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./romuald-guiot-bio-age-wife-spring-baking-championship.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Pastry Chef Romuald Guiot!
