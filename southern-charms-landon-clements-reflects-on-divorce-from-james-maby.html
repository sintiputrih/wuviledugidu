The former <a href=#>Southern Charm </a>star shared a photo from her 2008 nuptials to her ex-husband,<strong> James Maby,</strong> in honor of what would have been their 10th wedding anniversary.</p><p>“My sister in law (ex) just reached out to wish me a happy what would have been my 10th wedding anniversary,” the 36-year-old reality TV personality captioned a <a href=#>photo</a> on Wednesday, October 24, of her father walking her down the aisle. “It is sort of bittersweet but if something is not working for you find the strength to walk away. Learn the lessons and try to keep a smile on your face.”</p><p>Clements added that “one of her favorite moments” from her wedding was with her father.</p><p>“Sadly, there are no good photos with my Mother as she was scrambling around helping everyone else because there was a full on hurricane outside these church walls. To everyone that was there that day thank you and I love you,” she wrote. “And to everyone who needs a new direction in life go for it don’t be afraid, it’s ok to talk about things that hurt it’s the only way to get past them.”</p><p>Clements, who starred on Southern Charm seasons 2-4, split from Maby before she joined the Bravo series. During a season 2 episode that aired in May 2015, an emotional Clements received her divorce papers in Charleston.</p><p>“It’s time to deal with the legal aspect of what it really means to get divorced and start your life over,” she said on the show at the time. “No one in my family has been divorced … It was just this, like, Southern pride. You made this decision to marry him and now you have to toughen off and figure out how to stick with your decision. … It was really hard to tell my mom I was getting divorced.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite her divorce, Clements is still in touch with Malby’s teenager daughter Lola, whom he shares with his ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Stacey Dash.</strong></a></p><p>“You don’t divorce children,” Clements told Bravo’s <a href=#>The Daily Dish</a> in 2017. “Lola was 3 when I started dating my ex and she just turned 14 last week. So I’ve sort of raised a child. I know what it is. I was the girl scout leader when she was in kindergarten and you know did all of this stuff. I love it. I have two nieces. I come from a really big family, so that’s just very natural to me.”</p><p>Southern Charm is expected to return to Bravo in 2019.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasp6Wptaa%2BzWaaoZmiosBuuMCnm6imXZi5prnEp6usZaKas62xwq2qZqeeYrGqws6rmp5llqe8rnnJmqSeq12irqPFjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sunnyside-magic-high-season-release-date-cast-plot-update-trailer.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sunnyside Magic High Season 1: Release Date, Cast, Plot, Trailer, And Other Important Details You Mu</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ryan-seacrest-was-once-close-to-proposing-w480578.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ryan Seacrest Was Once Close to Proposing</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
