So, <strong>what is his current net worth?</strong> He may have been one of the highest-paid general managers in the NFL since his replacement in Seattle has already reached the list. Scott Patrick Fitterer, born on November 4, 1973, is a football executive with extensive experience.</p><p>Scott is a Seattle, Washington native who has always participated in a variety of sports. He has a history of being a two-sport athlete in college.&nbsp;He excelled in both baseball and football while at UCLA. Fitterer pitched for the Toronto Blue Jays for three seasons.&nbsp;Unfortunately, he was forced to withdraw from the sport owing to pressing shoulder issues. Fitterer started his NFL career as a part-time area scout for the New York Giants in 1998.</p><p>Fitterer was hired as an area scout by the Seattle Seahawks in 2001. Scott was then named co-director of player personnel by the Seahawks.&nbsp;His efforts were rewarded in 2020 when he was promoted to vice president of football operations.&nbsp;Fitterer was appointed general manager of the Carolina Panthers on January 14, 2021.</p><h2>Scott Fitterer Salary & Net Worth in 2024</h2><p><strong>Scott Fitterer’s net worth</strong> is impossible to ascertain since neither he nor the club have published his income. Scott signed a 5-year deal with the Seahawks in 2021, which concluded with him joining the Carolina Panthers.&nbsp;However, when his compensation is compared to that of other NFL general managers, his net worth is projected to be between $3.74 million and $6 million.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Scott-Fitterer-1.jpg alt="Scott Fitterer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Why? The Seattle Seahawks pay its general manager, John Schneider, $3.75 million a year.&nbsp;Scott joined the Panthers after leaving the Seahawks. As a result, he has joined the Panthers, most likely because they offered him a bigger contract than the Seahawks.&nbsp;Furthermore, Panthers owner David Tepper is one of the NFL’s wealthiest owners right now. He is the 90th wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of roughly $20.6 billion.&nbsp;Tepper would have spent a lot of money to retain Scott on his squad.&nbsp;Despite the Panthers releasing him early, Scott has greatly boosted his net worth while working with Tepper.</p><h2>Scott Has Been Fired by the Panthers</h2><p>Following the Panthers’ 2-15 record in 2023, owner David Tepper’s charity ran out, and the organization dismissed general manager Scott Fitterer after three seasons.&nbsp;Fitterer, who was named general manager during Matt Rhule’s tenure, had various challenges.&nbsp;Following a 1-10 record, head coach Frank Reich was fired in Week 13.</p><p>In addition, he brokered a high-stakes deal to obtain the first overall selection in the 2024 NFL Draft, which he used to choose Alabama quarterback Bryce Young.&nbsp;The Panthers’ poor performance, however, resulted in the NFL’s poorest record, and they surrendered the first-round pick to the Chicago Bears.&nbsp;Fitterer’s free-agent signings, notably Adam Thielen and DJ Chark, also failed to live up to expectations. Furthermore, his draft choices, notably those in the 2023 class, generated erratic results.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Scott-Fitterer-2.jpg alt="Scott Fitterer" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Scott was dismissed by the Panthers after going 14-37 during his tenure due to coaching and quarterback issues. Despite several successes in free-agent acquisitions, Fitterer’s tenure was hampered by serious shortcomings, causing Tepper to fire him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqnKekqXqntdOtnKudomK7psCMsKarrJhiwKK4wKuwZp2opbmwvsRmm6KcXZius7vLoqWaZaCWu7W0xKuqZqqVlrmtxYyfoKudlGK1qrmO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./skyler-gisondo-net-worth-185274.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Skyler Gisondo Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zendaya-sexy-photos.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Her Best Looks of All-Time Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
