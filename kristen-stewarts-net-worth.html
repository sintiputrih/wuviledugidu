Kristen Stewart has risen to the top of our annual list of Hollywood’s highest-paid actresses.</p><p>Is there anyone else who could play Bella Swan in the Twilight franchise at this point? Probably not; fans would rebel if the studio tried to replace her with someone else.</p><p>As a result, Stewart was able to demand an estimated $12.5 million a film plus a cut of the profits for the last two Twilight pictures.</p><p>Her co-stars, Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner, are paid similarly, but Stewart made more this year thanks to Snow White and the Huntsman. Stewart earned $34.5 million between May 2011 and May 2012, putting her at number 43 on our Celebrity 100 list.</p><p>Stewart, who is 22, is the 16-year-oldest woman on our list. Kristen Wiig, the 38-year-old, is the next youngest. Last year, Stewart tied for fifth place with Julia Roberts on our list of the Highest-Paid Actresses. Roberts was sixth this year.</p><h3>Kristen Stewart | Income</h3><p><strong>Kristen Stewart’s annual income is estimated to be $25 million as of 2023.</strong></p><p>Not only was Twilight a huge success in her career, but she also made another Twilight film series.</p><p>However, it dominated the box office in the United States, grossing over $290 million. Both Stewart and Pattinson gained a largely youthful and teen fan following as a result of this film.</p><p>The Twilight Installation, however, did not end there. Finally, in 2012, The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2 brought the series to a close for all Twilight lovers.</p><p>This film, like the others, was a big box office hit, grossing $140 million in its first week. This film was likewise a huge hit all around the world. It brought in roughly $3 million around the world.</p><p><strong>Let’s have a look at Kristen Stewart’s earnings from the year 2008-2013:</strong></p><table class="table biofactstable"><tbody><tr><th>Year</th><td><strong>Earnings</strong></td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-adjust"></i>2008</th><td>$2,000,000</td></tr><tr><th>2010</th><td>$28.5 Million</td></tr><tr><th><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-tower"></i>2011</th><td>$12,500,000</td></tr><tr><th>2012</th><td>$34.5 Million</td></tr><tr><th>2013</th><td>$22 Million</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Kristen Stewart’s Net Worth in Different Currencies</h2><p>Let’s take a look at Kristen Stewart’s Net Worth in several currencies, including BitCoin, the cryptocurrency.</p><table class=mytable width=696><tbody><tr><td><strong>Currency</strong></td><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Euro</strong></td><td>€ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":59531394.99999999}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDEUR")*R[-1]C[-1]'>59,531,395</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pound Sterling</strong></td><td>£ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":50480850}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14851,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"12":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDGBP")*R[-2]C[-1]'>50,480,850</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Australian Dollar</strong></td><td>A$ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":95172000}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDAUD")*R[-3]C[-1]'>95,172,000</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Canadian Dollar</strong></td><td>C$ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":87930499.99999999}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDCAD")*R[-4]C[-1]'>87,930,500</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Indian Rupee</strong></td><td>₹ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":5195837500.000001}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDINR")*R[-5]C[-1]'>5,195,837,500</span></td></tr><tr><td><strong>BitCoin</strong></td><td>฿ <span data-sheets-value='{"1":3,"3":1642.1880999999998}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":14339,"3":{"1":2,"2":"#,##0"},"4":{"1":2,"2":16777215},"14":{"1":2,"2":2236962},"15":"Inconsolata, monospace, arial, sans, sans-serif","16":11}' data-sheets-formula='=GOOGLEFINANCE("CURRENCY:USDBTC")*R[-6]C[-1]'>1,642</span></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Kristen Stewart | House and Cars</h2><h3>House</h3><h4>Bel-Air mansion</h4><p>Kristen Stewart rented a residence in Los Angeles for a few months in 2011, but it was rumored that she had moved out a few months ago. The mansion she stayed in, on the other hand, was a real stunner, with a real estate value of around $6 million.</p><p>The house is located in the upscale Bel-Air neighborhood on the westside of Los Angeles, California. The house has 5 bathrooms and 5 bedrooms and is 2,604 square feet.</p><p>Hardwood floors and a high wood ceiling highlight the huge living and dining space. A wide terrace is located just outside this room and is great for barbecuing, swimming, and relaxing. It also features a pavilion where you may view the sunset.</p><p>On the main level, there is a separate media room and bathroom and a modern kitchen.</p><p>The master suite, which features French doors that go out to the lawn and a couple of bedrooms, a bathroom, and a laundry, are all located on the lower level. A separate guesthouse with a total area of 1,440 sq ft is also available.</p><p>The entire property is well-protected, with massive gates. Every room in the house has a breathtaking view of the Canyon Reservoir and valleys.</p><p>Wealthy and well-known individuals populate the neighborhood. It is one of LA’s most affluent neighborhoods, and its real estate prices reflect this.</p><h4>Los Feliz Home</h4><p>Kristen Stewart, who plays Bella Swan in the Twilight franchise, has purchased a $2.2 million luxury villa 1.5 miles from Robert Pattinson’s home.</p><p>After their much-publicized breakup and her affair with married film director Rupert Sanders, the actress had previously moved out of the house she shared with her lover Robert Pattinson.</p><p>Following her recent reconciliation with ex-boyfriend Robert Pattison, the actress has returned to the same neighborhood. Her new home is only 2.5 kilometers away from her former one.</p><p>The mansion’s architecture is an intriguing mix of contemporary and southwestern influences. The property is located within a gated enclave in Los Angeles’ affluent Los Feliz district.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kristen-2.2million-house.jpg><p>The mansion has a total floor area of 3,365 square feet and includes four bedrooms, a large living room, one dining room, four bathrooms, and a modern modular dine-in kitchen. At any given time, the garage can accommodate up to six large vehicles.</p><p>The courtyard adjacent to the mansion has been tastefully adorned with lush green vegetation and features a large swimming pool and a stone-paved deck area.</p><p>A stacked stone fire pit has been installed on the patio. The villa’s flooring is decorated with high-end materials such as wide plank wood and Saltillo tiles, which give them an exquisite appearance.</p><p>After a long day at work, the actress prefers to unwind by visiting the indoor spa.</p><p>In addition, in 2013, she upped the ante by purchasing a 6,000-square-foot property in Malibu for $4.8 million. She planned to sell this home for $9.5 million in September 2020.</p><p>She paid $5.6 million for a New York City loft in 2017.</p><h3>Cars</h3><h4>Toyota Tacoma</h4><p>Many people would not equate a Hollywood celebrity with a pickup truck, but this young actress does own a Toyota Tacoma. It’s a two-door vehicle with air conditioning, a bed utility rail system, and a CD player as standard equipment.</p><p>It has a 2.7-liter four-cylinder engine that makes 159 horsepower. When it comes to transmission, these cars normally have an option of 4 speed automatic or 5-speed manual.</p><p>The interior is fairly spacious, yet several people have complained about the seat comfort.</p><h4>Dodge Magnum</h4><p>Kristen drives a Dodge Magnum for her family. Nothing compares to the Dodge Magnum in terms of style, power, and utility. A 200 horsepower V6 engine powers the Magnum.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Kristen-Stewart-Wearing-Short-Shorts-1024x734.jpg><p>The Dodge is available with all-wheel drive. These automobiles are helpful in inclement weather. In terms of speed, the automobile can cover a quarter-mile in under 14 seconds.</p><p>The vehicle also comes with a five-speed automatic transmission and luxurious amenities.</p><h4>Mini Cooper</h4><p>Kristen, believe it or not, also owns a Mini Cooper. Her car choices are odd, to say the least. Although it appears to be a British car, the Mini Cooper is the result of German engineering.</p><p>It’s noted for its nimble handling, excellent fuel economy, and unique convertible roof. We have no way of knowing whether she has a customized model or not.</p><p>On the other hand, the automobile has been chastised for lack of rear legroom and a subpar base radio.</p><h2>Kristen Stewart | Lifestyle and Vacation</h2><h3>Lifestyle</h3><p>Kristen Stewart, known for her turbulent relationships and scandals, rose to prominence after her prominent success in the “<strong>Twilight</strong>” series was recognized and commended by audiences worldwide.</p><p>In the most successful series of her career, “<strong>Twilight</strong>,” the actress was adored and praised for her dull reflecting character and plain gloomy appearance.</p><p>Her slim body frame and natural beauty always helped her in all of her public and social appearances. Kristen, according to the closest sources, was not a fitness freak.</p><h4>Diet Plan</h4><p>Despite staying up late, eating poorly, and smoking many cigarettes, she had a naturally slender body that helped her stay in shape.</p><p>However, after landing some extremely challenging roles in her films, she began to live a better lifestyle, eating lighter foods and working out daily.</p><p>Food is a weakness for tomboyish Hollywood beauty. Kristen was never concerned about her nutrition because she was a foodie.</p><p>However, as an actress who must meet the needs of all characters, the 31-year-old actress attempts to eat low-fat foods to maintain her health.</p><h4>Work Out</h4><p>Due to her slim body, Kristen Stewart had no desire to exercise. Kristen, on the other hand, maintained a strict workout plan to acquire her ideal curves.</p><p>When asked about her fitness secret for one of her future films, Kristen replied in an interview, “Physically, I had never challenged myself as much as I did on this film.” I literally ruined myself, and by the time it was over, I could hardly move.”</p><h4>Brands</h4><p>During brief visits, Kirsten has been seen carrying an Assembly New York Signature Backpack. This is a canvas bag from Assembly New York, a men’s and women’s shop specializing in international luxury names.</p><p>There are hidden silver zippers and an outer zipper pocket on these backpacks. There is also an open side pocket for the user’s convenience.</p><p>The sweet-looking actress wore this pendant at the video premiere of “<strong>My Valentine</strong>,” She has continued to wear it on her travels and public appearances since then.</p><p>Cartier is the most well-known jeweler globally, and they have a genuine variety of vintage pendant necklaces. It has become a well-known symbol of a strong female presence.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kristen-wearing-cartier.jpg><p>The actress has been seen wearing Paul Smith Lonnie Sunglasses on multiple occasions. These are high-end sunglasses designed by Sir Paul Smith, a well-known English fashion designer.</p><p>He is best recognized for his high-end menswear range. In the fashion sector, he has garnered a lot of respect. When she goes out, she wears this pair of shoes.</p><p>These sneakers were created with women’s feet in mind and featured a superior fit. The shoe’s overall appearance is unaffected by the simplified style. The canvas upper and rubber sole are quite durable, and the shoe is extremely stylish.</p><p>Kristen is so enamored with her Balenciaga quilted motorbike jacket that she owns three of them in different colors: brilliant red, pastel yellow, and black.</p><h3>Vacation</h3><p>Kristen Stewart, who starred in the Twilight franchise, took a break with her ex-boyfriend, Robert, in 2013.</p><p>According to Hollywood Life, the couple had a little holiday at Jules Stewart’s home after just reuniting months apart while Pattinson was filming his current film The Rover in Australia.</p><p>At Kristen’s mother’s house in Malibu, Rob and Kristen spent Easter together. Kristen’s brothers were also present, so it was a low-key affair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthypeeps.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/kristen-stewart-and-robert-pattinsons-holiday-711x1024.jpg><p>Rob went paddleboarding during the day. Jules lives on a private beach, which is where Rob always goes paddleboarding. It’s really private and secluded. As far as I know, everything in Rob and Kristen’s world is ideal. They’re overjoyed to be back together.</p><p>While the pair went through a hard patch last year after Stewart had an affair with married filmmaker Rupert Sanders, acquaintances claim they are now happier than ever.</p><p>Kristen and Rob are overjoyed with their new home. They get along swimmingly and thoroughly enjoy each other’s company. Rob has been lavishing his devotion to Kristen.</p><h2>Kristen Stewart | Movies, TV Appearances, Endorsements, Books</h2><h3>Movies</h3><p>Stewart got her first break when a talent agent noticed her in elementary school performance. Following that, she spent a year applying for other parts until earning a small, non-speaking role in a Disney Channel TV movie.</p><p>From then, she landed a series of tiny roles before landing the role of Jodie Foster’s daughter in David Fincher’s thriller <strong>Panic Room</strong>.</p><p>After her remarkable performance in <strong>Panic Room</strong>, it was only a matter of time before Stewart was starring in her own movie.

There was also a lot of talk in the media about the two having an off-screen romance.</p><p>Three more Twilight films followed, culminating in the 2012 conclusion. <strong>The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 2</strong> was the most recent film, grossing more than $140 million in its first weekend alone.</p><p>According to the sources, the Twilight films grossed more than $3 billion worldwide.</p><h3>Endorsements</h3><p>Kristen Stewart was the only presenter at Chanel’s Métiers D’Art presentation, which occurred at Château de Chenonceau in France’s Loire Valley on Tuesday, December 1.</p><p>After French Covid-19 regulations limited the number of VIP guests to one, the long-time Chanel ambassador was selected as the event’s sole visitor.</p><p>In 2002, Stewart starred in a Porsche commercial. She also does perfume endorsement work for Balenciaga.
