So, by the time this article was written, Charlie was 20 years old. Moreover, his birthday on September 16 suggests that his zodiac is Virgo.</p><h2><span id=Charlie_Gillespie_Wiki_Fathers_Siblings_Education>Charlie Gillespie Wiki Fathers, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p><strong>Charlie Gillespie</strong> was born to parents of white Caucasian ethnicity and Canadian nationality, but their names were unknown. Charlie’s musical disposition is due in large part to his growing up in an artistic household. Among his three siblings (two brothers and one sister), his brothers Patrick Gillespie and Michael Gillespie are musicians. Likewise, his sister, Meghan Gillespie, is a dancer. Apart from his siblings, Charlie also had a cousin named Maddie Leblanc, with whom he was very close.</p><p>Talking about his education, there was no information about where he finished high school. However, in December 2015, Charlie posted on his Instagram that he was about to finish his high school graduation.</p><h2><span id=Charlie_Gillespie8217s_Height_Weight_Body_Measurement>Charlie Gillespie’s Height, Weight, Body Measurement</span></h2><p>At the age of twenty, Charlie Gillespie was 5 ft 10 inches tall. While he was already quite tall, there was room for a little more growth. In the meantime, he weighed 78 kg.</p><p>Charlie had a beautiful face, dark black hair that came down to his shoulders, and piercing green eyes. He had a ripped body, too, and he took full advantage of it when he posed shirtless for the photoshoot of Alex Jackson.<br>Like that, Max Boyens Wiki, Girlfriend, Dad, Mom, Net Worth, Height</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Reach_GI_Twitter_FB>Social Media Reach: GI, Twitter, FB</span></h2><p>Charlie was still new to the show business, with only a few TV shows in his name. Thus, his social media presence was also at its infancy, which means that it will grow rapidly in the coming days.</p><p>Yet, for a newcomer, his presence in social media was still unbelievable. On his Instagram, he was 12.4k with 327 posts [Aug 2020].</p><h2><span id=Charlie_Gillespie8217s_Net_Worth_movies_television_shows>Charlie Gillespie’s Net Worth, movies, television shows</span></h2><p>Coming to Charlie’s professional career, we’ve already said he’s both an actor and a musician. His acting credits include the CW series Charmed, an American supernatural fantasy series, in which he played a minor role.</p><p>He also appeared in Family Channel’s Teen Drama Degrassi: Next Class, in which he appeared again in a very minor role. His first major role was in Julie and the Phantoms of Netflix, which we have already mentioned.</p><p>In Julie and the Phantoms, Charlie played the role of Luke, a guitarist, and singer who came back as a phantom and formed a band with Julie. Besides Luke, there are other famous musicians: bassist Reggie (played by Jeremy Shada) and drummer Alex (played by Owen Patrick Joyner). The three ghosts join hands with the living Julie (played by Madison Reyes) to make a band. The four main cast members of the show were friends in real life, too.</p><h2><span id=Charlie_Gillespie8217s_Girlfriend_Gay_and_Dating>Charlie Gillespie’s Girlfriend, Gay, and Dating</span></h2><p><strong>Charlie Gillespie’s</strong> dating life is where the web was almost empty. His Instagram was filled with posts about his friends, siblings, and cousins, places he had visited, but they were almost nil for his girlfriends. The only thing related to love, dating, or married life was a congratulation to his friend and co-star Jeremy Shada, who was married on 9 March 2020.</p><p>There were some rumors that he was gay, but again the only real relation to homosexuality he had was the fact that the character of Alex, Julie, and Phantoms was gay.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>William J.
