It’s funny. Dadbods are in!’” he says. “That’s not very reassuring. It’s like, ‘Thank you?’ With a question mark at the end.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1fa181e6086e4f671caf67f14805fc57-3-0-0@published data-word-count=89>In his defense, Hudson says that when he signed up for the role of Wes Gardner, the overly concerned father to protagonist Grace (Skyler Samuels), he was in great shape. Then he hurt his ankle and couldn’t run or train, and he moved with his family to New Orleans last summer to film the 13-episode series. As anyone who has even heard of the city could tell you, he spent most of his time eating rich foods and drinking rather than pecking on quinoa and sucking down green juice.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1fa181e6086e4f671caf67f14805fc57-4-0-0@published data-word-count=75>“I read the script toward the ends of the summer saying, ‘You are in a Speedo with fucking Jamie Lee Curtis.’ This is not good news,” he says. “That was my main concern after I realized I gained 15 pounds. But if I was in shape, it wouldn’t be as funny … Honestly, you become uninhibited when you’re that naked … I was able to be a complete maniac and let loose and have fun.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1fa181e6086e4f671caf67f14805fc57-5-0-0@published data-word-count=61>Hudson says the scene was one of his favorites this season, but he’s still a little pissed the killers turned out to be Boone (Nick Jonas) and Hester (Lea Michele) instead of him. “It’s always fun being the guy doing everything,” he says. “If the consolation prize is having to be in a Speedo with Jamie Lee Curtis, I’ll take it.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1fa181e6086e4f671caf67f14805fc57-6-0-0@published data-word-count=74>There was some fan speculation early in the series that he could be the one trying to get revenge for his girlfriend dying in a sorority bathtub, the incident that set off the show’s revenge plot, but it wasn’t meant to be. “It was nice to be part of the conversation,” he says. “I was hoping I would get to be the killer, but it was too obvious. I knew it wouldn’t be me.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1fa181e6086e4f671caf67f14805fc57-7-0-0@published data-word-count=64>The cast didn’t know who the baddie would be until the read the final script a little more than a month ago. “You could have plucked out any character, and through flashbacks, you could have explained how and why they were the Red Devil,” he explains. “I’m not convinced they knew from the beginning. They said they did, but it could have changed throughout.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1fa181e6086e4f671caf67f14805fc57-8-0-0@published data-word-count=72>Hudson’s Wes survived the final episode, had the best sex of his life with Curtis’s murderous Dean Munsch, and the two rode off happily into the sunset together. “From a character standpoint, it shows how shallow Wes is,” he says. “Sex equals love for him. Sex equals going to Napa and spending the rest of your life with a woman who is 15 to 20 years older than him that murdered people.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1fa181e6086e4f671caf67f14805fc57-9-0-0@published data-word-count=76>Wes’s other love interest, the deranged Gigi (Nasim Pedrad), turned out to be one of the Red Devil killers as well. “I think that speaks to the male species,” Hudson jokes about Wes staying with these dangerous women, adding that he would never continue dating a killer. “If I knew, absolutely not. Not a chance. There was no justification for murder for me to be like, ‘Yeah, I’ll stick with you and see where this goes.’”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1fa181e6086e4f671caf67f14805fc57-10-0-0@published data-word-count=51>Ironically for Hudson, his character on the slasher show survived the entire season, but his character on <i>Nashville</i>, sleazy music executive Jeff Fordham, was killed off earlier this fall. He only had a one-year contract on <i>Nashville </i>and decided to take the <i>Scream Queens </i>gig when it was offered to him.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-1fa181e6086e4f671caf67f14805fc57-11-0-0@published data-word-count=51>“Fox was gracious enough to give ABC four episodes with me, and they thought,&nbsp;<i>If we only get four episodes, let’s throw him off a building</i>,” he says, adding that his <i>Nashville</i> character may have been the biggest killer of all. “I’m sure Jeff has killed people we don’t even know about.”</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>Oliver Hudson Is Embarrassed About His Dadbod</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobmdhZ3ywuMivnKtlmKqxtLvNZqqcqpWWum691J6cp6tdma6lecGom2egpKK5</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./umaro-bacon-net-worth-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Umaro Bacon Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./multiple-grass-fires-break-out-in-boulder-county-amid-strong-winds.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Multiple grass fires break out in Boulder County amid strong winds</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
