Before she became a well-known actress, she married her high school sweetheart, Joe Gonzalez, in 1990.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>They had a son named Manolo in 1991, but after two years, they decided to go separate ways. After splitting from Gonzalez, Vergara dated but didn’t think about getting married again right away because she was focused on raising her son.</span></p><p><span>Sofía Vergara and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Joe Manganiello</a>, who were married for seven years, announced their breakup on July 17, 2023. Manganiello officially filed for divorce two days later, and by February 2024, it was all settled.</span></p><p><span>Vergara and Manganiello first met in 2014, introduced by actor Jesse Tyler Ferguson at a dinner. At that time, Vergara was engaged to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nick Loeb</a>. A few weeks later, Vergara broke up with Loeb, and then Manganiello asked Ferguson for Vergara’s number.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Even though Vergara didn’t think she was ready to date, Manganiello won her over, and the rest is history. Manganiello shared with People in 2020:</span></p><p><span>“I knew pretty quickly that I could trust her, and she knew pretty quickly that she could trust me. And we’re both the kind of people who are capable of putting the other person ahead of ourselves. I was capable of putting her wishes ahead of mine, whatever they were, and she was capable of doing the same. Once you have that, you don’t let go of it.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq5qoppyeu6Z6wqikaJuVobKjvsitsGiho2LAsLLImmSvnaKcrrOtjKmpnp%2Belru1e5NucGpvXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kate-middleton-roger-federer-reunite-at-wimbledon-pics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kate Middleton, Roger Federer Reunite at Wimbledon: Pics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swifts-dad-delivers-pizzas-to-fans-waiting-overnight-to-see-her.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift's Dad Delivers Pizzas to Fans Waiting Overnight to See Her</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
