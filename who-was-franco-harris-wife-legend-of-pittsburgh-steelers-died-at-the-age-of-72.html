Franco Harris went to Penn State University, which was also Dana Dokmanovich's alma mater. Harris always referred to Dokmanovich as his "wife," however it is unclear whether they ever married. They hadn't done so in August 1982, nearly a decade into their relationship, as reported by <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">GHLINKS</a>.</p><p>Dana Dokmanovich is of Serbian heritage, according to Blount Jr's book. She came to the United States as a child and had little recollection of her European background. In the 1980s, Dokmanovich worked as an Eastern Airlines flight attendant. Dana's mother, Bess Dokmanovich, lived in Pittsburgh with the couple and their son, Dok. She describes herself as&nbsp; "Franco's mother-in-law-so-to-speak," and she also served as his secretary.</p><p>In 1968, Harris graduated from Rancocas Valley Regional High School in New Jersey. He enrolled at Penn State the next year and graduated in the early 1970s. Harris was picked by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the first round of the 1972 NFL Draft. He would spend the following 11 years with the Steelers, as per reported by <a href=# rel=nofollow>New Jersey 101.5</a> News.</p><p>Franco Harris had his first child in 1979, seven years into his stint with the Steelers. Dana Dokmanovich gave birth to their son, Franco Dokmanovich Harris Jr, known as 'Dok.' Dok has chosen a different career, favoring science, inventions, and politics above sports. By the end of his twenties, Dok had earned the titles of innovator, broadcast personality, and entrepreneur, as reported by the <a href=# rel=nofollow>Focus</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikerit0madq5memLxutMCrqaKrXay2p7GMpZygnZ6ZerCyjKmgrayjl8Kzs8dmqq2dlaGys7%2BMnaCenF2WwW7Ax55kmp%2BVYryneZZr</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bachelor-nations-becca-kufrin-and-thomas-jacobs-get-married-one-month-after-welcoming-baby-boy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bachelor Nations Becca Kufrin and Thomas Jacobs Are Married</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-the-difference-between-direct-and-guaranteed-rural-housing-loan.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What is the difference between direct and guaranteed rural housing loan?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
