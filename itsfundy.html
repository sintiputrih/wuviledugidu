Likewise, a point multiplier makes each game worth more as each round passes, incentivizing teams to vote for games they might be bad at early on in the event. And, in the end, the two teams with the most points face off in a round of “Dodgebolt” to decide the winner of the tournament. Likewise, this makes it possible for a team to win despite potentially having fewer points than the runner-up.</p><p>Moreover, he also took part in this tournament. And, he was the last man standing. Likewise, his team technically scored 2nd place, as Fundy and RedVacktor were the last people alive. Moreover, he combat-logged near the end of the game when he was the last one alive besides Team 1.
