The comedian, 56, has been married to his longtime wife <strong>Jackie Sandler</strong> for 18 years now — a formidable run in the world of Hollywood. The couple shares <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two daughters</a>, <strong>Sadie</strong>, 16, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Sunny</strong></a>, 14, together, often making joint family appearances at red-carpet events. The whole family also joined him when he accepted the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in March 2023. Most recently, Jackie and Adam walked the red carpet together for the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> premiere of his movie </a>Murder Mystery 2&nbsp;on Tuesday, March 28, 2023.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Adam-Sandler-Jackie-Sandler-SS-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>While the two are relatively low-key compared to their celebrity couple counterparts, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Adam</a> and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jackie</a>, 48, are more connected than fans would assume. The actress and model has actually made cameos in countless of her husband’s films — and she also convinced Adam to take on one of the most memorable roles of his career. Some of Jackie’s most recent cameos include&nbsp;Hubie Halloween&nbsp;in 2020. She also appeared as the “Great looking flight attendant” in&nbsp;Murder Mystery&nbsp;in 2019, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>.&nbsp;While Adam prepares for the release of&nbsp;Murder Mystery 2, it’s not clear if Jackie will also make a cameo in the sequel with him and Jennifer Aniston, but fans will likely be on the lookout for her.&nbsp;Below is everything you should know about the comedian’s wife Jackie.</p><h2>Adam & Jackie Sandler</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adam-sandler-jackie-sandler-holding-hands-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Adam and Jackie tied the knot in June 2003 at <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dick Clark</strong>’s oceanfront Malibu home</a> before a slew of famous guests, including Jennifer, <strong>Dustin Hoffman</strong>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Brendan Fraser</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rob Schneider</strong></a>. The nuptials came after about four years of dating, as the two got together sometime in 1999. Adam and Jackie welcomed their first daughter Sadie in May 2006 and later, Sunny in November 2008.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>At the Uncut Gems premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2019, Adam shared his best secret to a long union. “Just getting time together,” he told reporters. “Making sure that you don’t run off too long and hanging out together and telling the truth.”</p><h2>How did Adam Meet Jackie?</h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As the story goes, Adam and Jackie met on set of the comedian’s 1999 film Big Daddy, which also starred <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Leslie Mann</strong></a>, <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jon Stewart</strong></a>, and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Dylan</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cole Sprouse</strong></a>. Jackie had a small role as the waitress that took Adam’s order at a sports bar — and clearly, sparks flew off-screen. The couple began their relationship shortly after. Since then, Jackie has made cameos in a series of her husband’s films, including Just Go With It, Grown Ups, Blended, Murder Mystery, and Hubie Halloween.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Besides the cameo, Adam shared more details about their first meeting at a birthday party when giving his acceptance speech for the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in March 2023. He called his their first meeting his “favorite night” of his life. “<strong>Stephen Dorf </strong>was having a birthday party, and my agent and buddy&nbsp;<strong>Adam Venice&nbsp;</strong>said to me, ‘Let’s go.’ I go. I sit at a table, and my buddy&nbsp;<strong>Dallas&nbsp;</strong>introduces me to that woman over there, and from that moment on, I couldn’t keep my eyes off her. She was sweet. She was gorgeous, as nice as it gets, and as luck would have it, she also had the habit of telling me I was great at everything,” he quipped. “In her eyes, I was the best. At least, that’s how she made me feel.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>When they aren’t in a film together, Jackie is still involved in her husband’s process. “We do this together, me and Jackie,” <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Adam told host <strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a> during an appearance on her talk show in December 2019. “Movies, you know, we discuss what I’m gonna to do. And she gives me strength and courage to jump into this stuff.” At the 2020 National Board of Review Gala, Adam also said <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Jackie convinced him to star</a> in his acclaimed film Uncut Gems: “My badass wife, she gave me the balls to take the part,” he said. “I was scared and she said, ‘Go f*cking do that’ and ‘you can do that sh*t’ and we rehearsed together all the time.”</p><h2>Adam Sandler’s Past Relationships</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Prior to settling down, Adam reportedly dated actress <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Alicia Silverstone</strong></a> very briefly in 1996. The Clueless actress even attended the premiere of the comedian’s 1996 film Happy Gilmore — and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rocked a t-shirt and baseball cap</a> that had the film’s title on them. Adam has also been linked to a businesswoman named <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Margaret Ruden</strong></a>; the two are believed to have been an item between 1992 and 1993.</p><h2>Adam Sandler’s Top Moments With His Wife</h2><p id=content-paragraph-12>In June 2023, Adam and Jackie celebrated their 20th wedding anniversary. The Click star paid tribute to their union by sharing a<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> throwback photo</a> from their wedding on <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> and penning a sweet caption. “Happy 20th my sweet Jackie! Your ‘I do’ was the best gift of my life,” he began in the June 22 post. “My heart has been yours since the first second I saw you and I love and appreciate your devoted soul more and more each day. Us. The kids. Lets keep going and going babe. Lots of love to give you. Always.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>In July 2020, Adam and Jackie celebrated a momentous milestone: their 22nd anniversary as a couple. The comedian shared a series of throwback photos on his Instagram and penned a sweet caption. “22 years ago today we locked eyes and fell deep,” Adam wrote. “Look forward to the next 22, young lady. Love you my forever girl.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>The longtime couple has shared major life moments together. In 2000, just three years before they tied the knot, Jackie converted to Judaism for her husband, who has long been vocal and proud of his Jewish roots. The two had a Jewish ceremony when they wed in 2003, where Adam rocked a tuxedo and yarmulke.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>The couple clearly have a loving and supportive marriage.&nbsp;During his interview with W Magazine last January, Adam <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>revealed that his wife wore a “Howard”</a> necklace to every Uncut Gems event with her husband, a reference to his character <strong>Howard Ratner</strong> in the film. He also revealed that Jackie is undeterred by his romance scenes in his films — and that she also gives him advice on them.</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>“When I have to do any romantic scenes in a movie I never get excited for that. I get tense and feel awkward. And then everyone else, I’m sure, is awkward,” he told the outlet. “My wife is always saying, ‘Just get in there. Do a good job. Be nice.'” Adam added that Jackie “loves” all of his female co-stars.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>“My wife loves the women I work with, so she’s very like, ‘Come on! Make sure you [do] the best you can. Give it up. It looks crazy when you don’t kiss good enough,'” he continues. “I’m very relieved when we do a movie and at the end of the script I go, ‘I don’t have to kiss anyone!’ Anyway, that’s fantastic. But when I do, I get it done. I get it done.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>On Mother’s Day 2021, Adam shared some rare photos of his wife on a beach and penned a sweet tribute to her. “Happy Mothers Day to this sweet lady who always makes life more fun and sweet for our girls,” the actor wrote. “You are our rock. Love you always and happy birthday to your beautiful mama today too!”</p><h2>Moving Forward</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adam-sandler-jackie-sandler-kids-SS-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-23>The comedian and his actress wife appear to have built a beautiful life together. As for whether more children will ever be on the horizon, who’s to say? But Adam has gushed about how his two daughters have changed his life for the better — but admitted <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>that there are some adjustments</a> that come along with fatherhood. “My kids give me the most joy, but there are life adjustments,” he told The Huffington Post in 2014. “I don’t go out to meet anyone after 9:30 at night. I eat dinner at six or seven.” He joked, “If someone makes me stay out until 10:30 at night, I’m angry the entire next day because I’m exhausted.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-24>In a separate interview with Ellen in April 2019, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Adam revealed that he is also adjusting</a> to his daughters’ newfound interest in boys. “You know, I drive around with [Sadie and] her friends and I hear them talking about boys now… it’s amazing, the feelings I had about the same boys five years ago,” the Billy Madison star said. “When they would mention the kid’s name, I’d be like, ‘I love that kid.’ Now… I get very jumpy.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-25>Like his wife, Adam’s daughters often make cameos in his films, including Hubie Halloween, Bedtime Stories, Hotel Transylvania, Grown Ups, Murder Mystery, and Jack and Jill. The actor doesn’t share much social media snapshots of his kids, but he will occasionally give fans glimpses of his wife on his page for special anniversaries and holidays. Given how low key the actor and his actress wife are, here’s to hoping fans will continue to receive these little glimpses into their decades-long relationship.</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>In his Mark Twain Prize acceptance speech, Adam credited all of his loved ones with making his life “fun.” Besides gushing about his wife, he also honored his and Jackie’s two daughters, speaking about how they make his life great. “Along came two of the true best things: babies showing up. Sadie and Sunny, they’re the love of our lives. The most pride and joy that Jackie and I could ever feel. The lifechangers, when they speak, we laugh, tear up, or just stare in amazement,” he said. “Being with you two and mommy, that’s the best life can get. They look like their mama, and their smart like their mama.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-27>Until then, fans will just have to wait for any potential cameos in the actor’s upcoming films. Jackie has accompanied her husband on the big screen many times already, after all.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8CdmKZlo5a7pbjEq2SwoZaaenWAl2xqcW5f</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./james-scholz.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>James Scholz Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Girlfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./elevating-the-eagles-the-reason-for-trading-for-t-j-watt.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Elevating the Eagles: The Reason for Trading for T.J.
