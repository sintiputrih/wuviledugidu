It’s not even past.” “When I discovered that quotation not long ago on BrainyQuote.com, I was thunderstruck,” the Duke of Sussex writes on page 13, quoting the Nobel Prize–winning American writer William Faulker to explain his own persistence of memory — the living recollections that enabled him to share stories of varying importance for 400 pages. “I thought, Who the fook is Faulkner? And how’s he related to us Windsors?” It’s unclear whether the prince ever realized who the fook Faulker was or that the closest the novelist got to being a Windsor was being a white man from Mississippi who joined the British Royal Airforce at the tail end of World War I before a peace deal was signed while he was still in ground school. What remains clear, though, is Harry’s commitment to a frank portrait of his early years and adulthood that offers more TMI moments than bombshell revelations.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcqihz4o000j3b6v5kqiqeom@published data-word-count=149>Ahead of the book’s release, “Page Six” gave us a taste of Spare when it somehow obtained a copy and <a href=#>published more than two dozen articles</a> with intimate details about Harry’s youth and upbringing, <a href=#>spats with his brother</a>, and relationship with his wife, <a href=#>Meghan Markle</a>. <a href=#>Viral screenshots of the many, many headlines</a> looked like parody tweets (e.g., Prince Harry claims King Charles told him there wasn’t “enough money” for Meghan) but were in fact very real, to our fascination. When news of a memoir from Princess Diana’s second-born son first dropped, no one could have anticipated that its anecdotes would touch on Prince William’s receding hairline, Harry’s losing his virginity to a spanking older woman, and a frostbitten penis. Despite feeling like a “spare” his whole life, Harry does everything but spare us the details. Here are the stories that stood out to us for their spectacularly strange candor.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clcl0xj17002l3b6v2n76ovjj@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>On His Youth and Time at War</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcqixo7k000o3b6v1lc4xvxu@published data-word-count=54><strong>He experimented with drugs as a teenager.</strong><br>“Of course,” he was “doing cocaine around this time,” Harry <a href=#>admits</a>, being first offered the drug “at someone’s country house, during a shooting weekend.” It made him “feel different” but not “particularly happy.” He also once hallucinated talking to a toilet after using mushrooms, per the <a href=#>Associated Press</a>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcl0xx95002x3b6vo3ambq7u@published data-word-count=46><strong>He says he lost his virginity at 17 in a field behind a pub to an older woman.&nbsp;</strong><br>“She liked horses, quite a lot, and treated me not unlike a young stallion,” Harry <a href=#>claims</a>. “Quick ride, after which she’d smacked my rump and sent me to grace.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcl0xx96002y3b6vr1ivmrke@published data-word-count=21>“Among the many things about it that were wrong, it happened in a grassy field behind a busy pub,” he continues.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcl0xx96002z3b6v998praq1@published data-word-count=48><strong>And blames William and Kate for his 2005 Nazi costume.&nbsp;</strong><br>“I phoned Willy and Kate, asked what they thought.

Kate grimaced.” Apparently, he thought she “should’ve been able to laugh about” the whole thing, but he “sensed” it was going to mushroom into “something bigger.” At the time, he thought Kate would be on “edge” because she was “going to be compared to, and forced to compete with, Meg.” Cue the dramatic music.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clcl119ut004e3b6v0ggs0vie@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>On His Dad, King Charles</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clcl11g9e004k3b6v3ra1ut5q@published data-word-count=62><strong>When Harry was little, his pa would do headstands in his skivvies.</strong><br>“Open the wrong door and you might burst in on Pa while his valet was helping him dress,” he writes. “Worse, you might blunder in as he was doing his headstands.

In Spare, he reveals both he and William retraced their mother’s final steps at Pont de l’Alma, trying to pinpoint what exactly led to her death. Eventually, Harry began to theorize about the possibilities. “With nothing to do but roam the castle and talk to myself, a suspicion took hold, which then became a firm belief. This was all a trick,” he <a href=#>writes</a>. “And for once the trick wasn’t being played by the people around me, or the press, but by Mummy. Her life’s been miserable, she’s been hounded, harassed, lied about, lied to. So she staged an accident as a diversion and run away.” School “matrons” encouraged him to write a “final” letter to his mother, but he decided to leave his suspicions out of it.
