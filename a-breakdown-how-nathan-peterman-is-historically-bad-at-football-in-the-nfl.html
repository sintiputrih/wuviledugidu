He's taken a rocky road from college football to the NFL, mixed with a ton of hardships, and an all-time bad NFL debut.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>College Stint and NFL Draft</h2><p>Peterman began his college career playing for the Tennessee Volunteers before transferring to the University of Pittsburgh in 2015 as a graduate transfer. His journey to the NFL started when he was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the fifth round of the 2017 NFL Draft.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>NFL Debut Disaster</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1><span data-mce-fragment=1>The hype around Peterman rose when he was named the Bills' starting quarterback in 2017. However, his NFL debut against the Los Angeles Chargers turned into a nightmare. He threw an astonishing five interceptions in the first half, an unprecedented feat in modern football history</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>. This catastrophic performance led to his benching at halftime and marked the beginning of his struggles in the league.</span></p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Historic Infamy</h2><p>However, Peterman was historically bad in his debut, finishing with an absurd 0.0 passer rating. The legacy of his NFL career&nbsp;is set, the record-breaking incompetence would follow him, and he would never evolve past the promise bestowed upon him in both high school and college.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>More Struggles&nbsp;</h2><p><span data-mce-fragment=1>Despite subsequent opportunities, Peterman's struggles persisted. His career NFL statistics as of 2023 include 160 passing attempts, 85 completions, a completion percentage of 53.1%, 4 touchdowns, and a staggering 13 interceptions.</span><span data-mce-fragment=1>&nbsp;His on-field performance failed to reflect the potential that many had hoped for when he entered the NFL.</span></p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Impact on the Buffalo Bills</h2><p>The aftermath of Peterman's debut debacle affected the Buffalo Bills with force. The team had the difficult task of handling a disgruntled QB who had not lived up to those sky-high expectations placed upon him. His historical showing had rippling effects throughout the building that trickled down to future quarterback decisions and team dynamics. Thankfully, a year later they would draft their&nbsp;franchise QB, superstar Josh Allen in the 2018 first round.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Legacy and Lessons Learned</h2><p>Nathan Peterman's short NFL experience is a stark example of just how&nbsp;brutal&nbsp;professional sports can be. Somehow, he is still a third string quarterback for the New Orleans Saints currently and managing to to&nbsp;stay in the league while doing nothing productive all these years later.&nbsp;<br data-mce-fragment=1>Overall, Nathan Peterman will always be known for arguably the worst game any quarterback has had since at least the turn of the century, and he'll forever serve as a reminder of just how merciless the NFL can be on young quarterbacks. To go from college to the pros, his path was more serpentine, a cautionary tale in trying to predict sports.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6RflnqjvsSaop2np6N6qbvWZqWarJiWu268xK2cq6WRo3qqv4yhoKysn6e2pK3LpbBmmpGZeqLAjJ%2BmqKySlrmtecinZK2glWK7p7g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./devon-aoki.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Devon Aoki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-biljana-electronica-planet-of-the-bass.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'Planet of the Bass' Singer Ms. Biljana Electronica Has Been Identified Who Is She?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
