The Feb. 6 episode of the reality dating series put a football game front and center, with Zach getting support from former NFL players <a href=#>Shawne Merriman</a> and Antonio Gates.</p><p>Both Merriman and Gates are best known for the years they spent as members of the San Diego Chargers, before the NFL franchise moved to Los Angeles.</p><p>But what about Zach? The football game has naturally piqued viewers' interest in the Bachelor star's own football history. Where did the new Bachelor play college football and how did his athletic career go?

What makes the school stand out is that not all of its 21 sports teams play in the same conference. The Cal Poly Mustangs are primarily members of the Big West Conference, which includes many California State University (CSU) and University of California (UC) schools.</p><p>However, the football team has been an affiliate member of the Big Sky Conference since 2012.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Cal Poly</a><p>Zach Shallcross as a senior with the Cal Poly football team</p></figure><p>The Mustangs have only made the playoffs twice since the move — in 2012, when they lost in the second round to Sam Houston State University, and in 2016 when they were eliminated in the first round by the University of San Diego.</p><p>Zach Shallcross was part of the 2016 Cal Poly Mustangs football team, having begun his college football career as a redshirt in 2014.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">What were Zach Shallcross's college football stats?</h2><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cal Poly Mustangs</a> official website, the 6'4", 280-lb right tackle was on their roster until 2018. Zach's career started quietly; after redshirting, he played in the 2015 Spring Game and then was a backup for six games during the 2015 season.</p><p>Yet in 2016, he helped lead the Mustangs to the "No. 1 national ranking in team rushing for [the] fourth consecutive year," while the team finished 7-5.</p><p>In 2017, Zach missed two games due to an injury but played in nine games, starting all but one of them. The team plummeted to a 1-10 record, losing every game except the Nov. 4, 2017 contest against Portland State.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Zach Shallcross (@zachshallcross)</a></p></figure><p>2018 was Zach's senior year and the Mustangs rebounded to a record of 5-6. They participated in a number of high-scoring games, including the shocking season opener in which they lost 49-3 to North Dakota State and a 52-10 loss to UC Davis on Oct. 20, 2018.</p><p>They also scored 42 points on the Montana State Bobcats on Nov. 3, only to narrowly lose 49-42.</p><p>While Zach's football career may not have been NFL-level, he's now sharing the field with some well-known NFL players on The Bachelor and certainly reaching a much wider audience than he did in college! And as he's <a href=#>not the first football player who's been on the show</a>, he's in some very good company.</p><p>The Bachelor airs on Mondays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfr66ktIysn5qknJi%2FsL%2FSZp2op6SXrq24</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./18-tanqueray-gin-nutrition-facts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>18 Tanqueray Gin Nutrition Facts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sheena-melwani.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sheena Melwani Age, Net Worth, Husband, Family and Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
