Elizabeth Renee Johnstone, aka Liz Johnston, is the second biological child of her parents, Trent and Amber Johnston.</p><p>Lately, as we can see in the show, Liz’s social life has had a huge boom as she spends a lot of time with her besties, Carol and Dacey, and her boyfriend, Brice. Since Liz regularly sees her friend Dacey, it’s only natural that the viewers of the show want to know more about her.</p><p>In this wiki article, we will talk about Dacey Triplett’s appearances on 7 Little Johnstons, her friendship with Liz, her job, and more.</p><h3><strong>Meet Liz’s Friend Dacey Triplett On 7 Little Johnstons</strong></h3><p>Liz’s friend Dacey Triplett first made her appearance in 7 Little Johnstons in January 2021 and as of this writing, she has appeared in quite a few episodes already.</p><p>Dacey Danielle Triplett made her debut in the TLC show alongside Liz’s other friend Carol. She had joined Liz, her boyfriend Brice, and Carol on their fishing trip. In her debut episode, she had some intense interrogation with Liz’s boyfriend Brice. Dacey grilled Brice by asking him how tall he is, how many children he wants, whether he has been arrested before–to which he said no–and if he is a daredevil.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Dacey-Triplett-300x195.jpg><p>As viewers have seen in the show, it’s quite evident that Liz considers Dacey one of her closest friends, alongside her boyfriend Brice and another bestie Carol.
