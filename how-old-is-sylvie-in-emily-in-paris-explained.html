She has never had the time — nor the will — to accept Emily in her life as anything other than a co-worker. But as heartless as she might be, Sylvie is the hard-as-nails boss that will get things done.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=472 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>In spite of her reluctance towards Emily, and initial downright belief in her inferiority, Sylvie slowly but surely started warming up to the American girl, albeit on a professional level. The hardworking Frenchwoman became known among fans for her working habits, professionalism, and of course, her relationship with Antoine that resulted in adultery. From the get-go, the show introduces Sylvie via her time at Savoir, where she has been an employee for over a decade.</p><p data-characters=218 data-current-count=218 data-injectable=false>Her longevity at the company and knowledgeable work ethic has left fans wondering exactly how old the former chief of marketing is. Although there is no exact answer, a few assumptions may lead in the right direction.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>Overall, Sylvie has been at Savoir for at least twelve years, when she met Antine Lambert for the very first time and kickstarted their decade-old affair. Considering Sylvie must have been in her late to mid-thirties when she met the charming Frenchmen, it is fair to assume currently, the blunt and hard-working boss is at least in her early fifties, or at the very least, late forties</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>The actress who plays the harsh-demeanor Sylvie is Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu. The Italian actress was born in 1963, making her 59 years old at the time of writing, and perfectly able to pass as someone a tad bit younger than her real age. While it could’ve been slightly difficult to make Sylvie much younger or much older than Leroy-Beaulieu, it makes sense that everyone’s favorite French boss is around the same age as her portrayer.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>All in all, while you should never ask a lady her age, it is more than fair to keep the innocent curiosity looming around everyone’s favorite characters, even if they’re the hard-stoned, intimidating, and still soft-hearted Sylvie Grateau.</p><p data-characters=40 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>Emily in Paris is streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ypu9ZmpqWcXZ7Abr%2FYpa2inV2eu26xzKKjsmWZo3qxrdGiqmadqKW5orXNnpto</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./is-kourtney-kardashians-new-skin-care-obsession-led-light-face-mask-safe.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Is Kourtney Kardashian's New Skin Care Obsession LED Light Face Mask Safe?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ritz-cracker-discontinued-reduced-fat.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Customers say they will 'no longer' be buying from the brand as Ritz confirms it has discontinued po</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
