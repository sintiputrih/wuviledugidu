However, he came into the spotlight back in 2013, when it was revealed that he’ll become the head football coach at the University of Arkansas.</p><p>It came as a shock to most of the college football world when he left the University of Wisconsin-Madison for Arkansas, since many thought that he was on top of the world with Wisconsin. More about the reasons why he left, and all about his journey from playing to coaching you’ll find out by reading this paper.

Bret was raised in his hometown by his parents, Arnie and Marilyn, alongside his four siblings, sisters Brandi and Betsy, and brothers Barry and Bart.</p><p>Growing up with two elder brothers, Bret followed in their footsteps, and from an early age competed in track, wrestling and football. He attended a local high school where he focused on football, playing linebacker and tight end.</p><p>Upon matriculating in 1988, he enrolled at the University of Iowa, where he was a defensive lineman, and in his senior year served as team captain; he graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Marketing in 1992. Bret signed as a free agent with Seattle Seahawks after going undrafted in the 1993 NFL draft, however, he was cut during the summer. In 1994, Bret played for the Milwaukee Mustangs, a professional Arena Football League team.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=from-iowa-hawkeye-to-nfl-coach></span>From Iowa Hawkeye to NFL Coach<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>At the end of the 1994 season, Bret returned to Iowa where he began his coaching career, as a graduate assistant. Two years later, he was promoted to linebackers coach, and served in this position until 2001.</p><p>From 2002 through 2003, Bret was co-defensive co-ordinator for the Kansas State Wildcats, helping them to win the 2003 Big XII Championship.</p><p>After that season, Bret was next hired as the defensive co-ordinator for the Wisconsin Badgers, under head coach Barry Alvarez, a position he served in for two years, and when Barry announced his retirement after the 2005 season, he stated that his successor would be Bret.</p><p>In his first season as the coach (2006), Bret became the third Wisconsin Badgers head coach to win the first three games of his career.

At the time, he was the highest-paid state employee in Arkansas, with a salary of over $4 million.
