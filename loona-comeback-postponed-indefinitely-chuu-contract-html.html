While BlockBerry denied the rumors in a statement and promised to take legal action against acts of defamation, it became clear that something was amiss when Chuu bowed out of LOONA‚Äôs first world tour this past summer.

Fans raised their eyebrows at the news. Reports of legal action taken against BlockBerry began to emerge in the spring, claiming Chuu sued to opt out of some parts of her exclusive contract. By June, outlets reported that the singer was <a href=#>shopping management companies</a> and setting up her own agency. While BlockBerry <a href=#>vehemently denied the reports</a> and threatened legal action against those who spread the rumors, the agency also announced that <a href=#>Chuu would sit out the group‚Äôs first world tour</a> (from August to October). For her part, Chuu continued to book variety shows, grow her YouTube channel, and release songs.

BlockBerry and the singer signed an exclusive contract in 2017. Earnings would be split at a 7:3 ratio with the agency taking in 70 percent of profits to Chuu‚Äôs 30 percent. At the same time, expenses would be split at a 5:5 ratio. A post-settlement system was adopted, meaning earnings were divided before subtracting expenses. Under this agreement, 20 percent of expenses would be transferred to LOONA members with each member amassing debt when expenses exceed 70 percent of revenue. Dispatch reported that each LOONA member, excluding Chuu, is 200 million won (approximately $153,500) in debt despite earning 18.6 billion won (approximately $14,275,000). Because Chuu had more activities and appearances than other members, she is not indebted to the company and had earned 220 million won (approximately $169,000) in payments since December 2021.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbzibswm00343b6vbngcbzn1@published data-word-count=101>After winning her contract dispute in January 2022, Chuu won the right to take profit from her individual activities, agreed to a more favorable annex contract, and negotiated the ability to sit out of certain group activities and terminate the contract at any time. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even want to participate in Queendom, but I did not want to give up LOONA either,‚Äù she told <a href=#>Dispatch</a>, referencing season two of a K-pop competition show. ‚ÄúI signed the annex to the contract in order to continue group activities.‚Äù It‚Äôs not clear whether or not other members have managed to sue for better contracts.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clbzicfp300393b6v7lxrfish@published>Is BlockBerryCreative actually that broke?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clbzicn35003f3b6vdn5xe0l2@published data-word-count=126>LOONA was an ambitious project from the start.

Following their contract suspension with BlockBerryCreative, members have turned to up-and-coming labels ran by their alums of their old agency. Hyunjin, Yeojin, Vivi, Gowon, and Hyeju will redebut as Loossemble under the new agency CTDENM, founded by former director Yoon Do-yeon. While dates have not been revealed, the quintet has announced plans to visit 10 cities on a tour titled ‚ÄúLOONA Assemble: the US Debut Ceremony.‚Äù Heejin, Haseul, Kim Lip, Jinsoul, and Cherry formed ARTMS under Modhaus, a new company started by another BlockBerryCreative executive, Jaden Jeong, who previously served as creative director to their former label. Modhaus represents the burgeoning girl group tripleS, who are responsible for the relatively successful track, ‚ÄúGeneration.‚Äù Teaming up with old BlockBerry employees could lead to various results, but one thing is certain ‚Äî&nbsp;the music was hitting, so perhaps they want to bottle up that success and combine it with good contracts. They certainly hit the ground running with recording ‚Äî LOONA subgroup Odd Eye Circle (Kim Lip, Jinsoul, and Choerry) came back with the mini-album Version Up on July 12, and are touring Europe in August. Modhaus has confirmed that Heejin is preparing to release a solo in October. Meanwhile, Chuu joined the agency ATRP, and already has an official fanclub name and lightstick as a soloist. Finally, Yves has announced that she also plans to redebut as a solo act.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cliytyvq7000u3b6ulgd52zkw@published data-word-count=28>Whatever the case may be, Orbits are bound to support LOONA so long as BlockBerry doesn‚Äôt stand to profit.
