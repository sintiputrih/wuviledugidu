According to a heartfelt interview with Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live&nbsp;in 2022, actor Matthew revealed he knew the moment he set eyes on Sarah that she was the one. "The first time I met her. I saw her walking down the street, and thought, 'That's it.'"&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">Don't miss</h4><p id=e11G8Po5SfX data-wc=33><a class=hm-link href=#>The loved-up duo</a> met in 1991 through Sarah's brothers Pippin and Toby, who were friends with The Lion King&nbsp;actor after he directed a play at their theatre company, Naked Angels Theatre Company.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/2408258ebe4c-gettyimages-1407122488.jpg><p id=eWw4Ka2oMMA data-wc=67>SJP had just split with her former beau and Sherlock Holmes star, Robert, so it took a few months, but eventually, the now-couple went out to the movies together. Matthew explained in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The New York Times&nbsp;in 1996</a>: "My memory is that literally months passed when I didn't ask her for a date," to which SJP replied, "Your memory is correct."</p><p id=eRj7jtisJqi data-wc=28>She added: "He left a very charming, very self-effacing message on the machine," she recalled. "You know, 'Hi, it's Matthew Broderick.' You had to use your last name."</p><h2 dir=ltr>When did Sarah and Matthew get married?</h2><p id=ehCmFoPR2xg data-wc=46><a class=hm-link href=#>Sarah and Matthew</a> went on to tie the knot on 19 May 1997, one year before Sex in the City&nbsp;graced our screens. The happy couple opted for a subtle affair and bamboozled guests with their invitations, which you can see below on the second slide.&nbsp;</p><p id=eFkN2nDSNXa data-wc=60>Rather than revealing the occasion was to mark their nuptials, Sarah and Michael pretended their get-together (of around 100 people), was simply a party. The actress, who is also <a class=hm-link href=#>famed for her incredible sense of style</a>, didn't even wear a traditional ivory wedding gown and instead opted for a waist-cinching black dress - but of course, she still looked flawless.</p><p id=e-S5L4Itnhj data-wc=26>Matthew's mom Patrica made a hilarious quip to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>People</a> magazine about the laid-back affair, jesting: "They're not the Kennedys," a fun call-back to Sarah's former beau.</p><p id=e1m024TwO2G data-wc=67>Sarah also opened up to the publication about her big day. "I never thought about a wedding dress. Never," she said. "[I] had not one daydream about it. At one point I just simply remember thinking, 'God, I really hope he asks me to marry him.' I don't know when or why. It was fairly early on." The couple celebrated their 26th Wedding Anniversary in May 2023.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Do Sarah and Matthew have children?</h2><p id=e0j8n-tmUHp data-wc=41>The husband-and-wife duo are doting parents to three children, James Wilkie, 20, and twin daughters Tabitha Hodge and Marion Loretta Elwell, 13.

"It's so confusing… But we really do cook 5 to 6 nights a week for sure. We try to always have a Sunday dinner – we invite people."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dYWUa29xZ6OWv6K0jKOcrKuZmK5uvMCrop6qXaKutcDHnq5mmqKksaa%2ByJyiZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tito-ortizs-biography-fact-career-awards-net-worth-life-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tito Ortizs biography, fact, career, awards, net worth &amp;amp; life story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rodney-razor.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rodney Razor</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
