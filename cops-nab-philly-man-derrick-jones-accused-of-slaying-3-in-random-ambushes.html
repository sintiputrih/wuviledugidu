He now faces three counts of murder and related charges, according to police.</p><p>“This is a total random act of violence, which we may never get to the bottom of and uncover why,” said Philadelphia Police Capt. Jason Smith.</p><p>Smith said the 21-year-old suspect has been silent since being taken into custody.</p><p>There is no connection between Jones and the three victims, the police captain said. Detectives were able to determine that the slayings were connected, however, because Jones allegedly followed a near-exact script for both hits.</p><p>Smith said detectives were able to connect the killings—on June 28 and July 7—to Jones using security footage, which tracked the shootings themselves and Jones fleeing to his apartment.</p><p>The victim of the first shooting was identified as 20-year-old Zamir Syrus. Footage captured him getting on a public bus around 10 p.m. and deboarding 15 minutes later. Jones, meanwhile, boarded one stop before Syrus and got off one stop later, Smith said.</p><p>Once both were off the bus, police say Jones and Syrus walked toward each other from seperate directions. Once they passed each other, Jones turned around, pulled out a gun and ran toward Syrus while firing “several shots at the victim’s back,” Smith said.</p><p>Syrus was taken to a local hospital but died there.</p><p>The next shooting, on July 7, was eerily similar to the first. But this time, police say, Jones killed two men in the attack.</p><p>Justin Robert Smith, 20, and Tyheim Tucker, 21, hopped off a public bus in North Philadelphia around 10:40 p.m. Jones, also on the bus, stepped off a stop later, Smith said. From here, the second slaying is said to mirror the first, except neither Smith nor Tucker were taken to a hospital after being gunned down. They were pronounced dead at the scene.</p><p>If it weren’t for his arrest Thursday, Smith suggested Jones may have struck again soon. The raid of his apartment uncovered a Glock handgun outfitted with an extended magazine and 31 live rounds inside—the same caliber bullets that were used in the shootings, police said.</p><p>Smith said the handgun did not have a listed owner. He added that Jones was barred from legally owning weapons after he was busted stealing a vehicle and convicted of other firearm charges in 2019, crimes he was still on probation for at the time of the killings.</p><p>“The motive is unknown, but that is the burning question,” Smith said. “Why? Why did Mr. Jones murder, in cold blood, three males?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnk6S9tHnNmplmqJieua3FjKaYp2WUmr%2BztcKkZKOnnprAbq3CnKysnZRivKd50qWYsqGenHp0ecinZKuZnpm8rnnAppmuq5iawHA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./1332623-impact-wrestling-ipwf-throwback-throwdown-iii-results-december-2-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>IMPACT Wrestling: IPWF Throwback Throwdown III Results December 2, 2022</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-geena-davis-wiki-bio-age-net-worth-career-affairs-family-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Geena Davis? | Wiki, Bio, Age, Net Worth, Career, Affairs,Family</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
