OK, so maybe in a movie like <i>Just Go with It</i> where [<a href=#><strong>Rachel Dratch</strong></a>’s] eyebrows are messed up, that’s funny. But not in real life when one eye is black and blue and way higher than the other. I cried and then I’m like, ‘When is this gonna go away?’”</p><p class=p1>Doctors ultimately told Spears to “give it a week or two” to account for unexpected swelling. “Sometimes <a href=#>the nerves act that way</a> and have a reverse effect, and I’m like, ‘I look like somebody beat the s—t out of me,’” she recalled on Friday. “So of course, I go back and show the doctor. She says that’s completely normal, and I said, ‘Then why can’t I go anywhere for two weeks?’ and my friend’s sisters laughed. <a href=#>F—K BOTOX, it is horrific</a>!!!”</p><p class=p1>Spears explained in a video posted to her Instagram that the Botox made her forehead swell up, which meant her eyelids “drooped over” to make it look like she had been in a fight. “To pay that much money to look like someone beat you up for the first two weeks? What’s the point?” she quipped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Britney-Spears-Had-Reverse-Effect-to-Botox-Says-She-Looked-Like-Somebody-Beat-the-S%E2%80%94t-Out-of-Me.jpg><p class=p1>After Spears denounced ever going back to <a href=#>get more Botox fillers</a>, she has since found success with the “unbelievable” Sio, which is a line of silicone patches that prevent the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines when applied to the face.</p><p class=p1>Spears, who married <a href=#><strong>Sam Asghari</strong> </a>in June 2022 <a href=#>after six years together</a>, has previously been candid about <a href=#>considering plastic surgery</a>.</p><p class=p1>“It’s crazy living in Los Angeles. I was thinking about getting a boob job. My boobs are fairly small,” she wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post in March 2022, per <a href=#><i>Glamour</i></a>. “I mean with the right bra it’s fine, but I was curious what a doctor would say! I lost seven pounds in the last six months and that’s a lot for me! I’m officially part of the ‘itty bitty titty committee.’ They shrunk!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>At the time, Spears claimed that she considered getting a <a href=#>breast augmentation</a> as a result of her father <a href=#><strong>Jamie Spears</strong></a>’ alleged body-shaming. “I’ve <a href=#>never been more humiliated and embarrassed</a> in my life during my conservatorship,” Britney alleged at the time. “Yes, I do care and anyone would if you saw yourself the way I have. My dad always told me I was fat and being the heavy girl on stage wasn’t fun. It was humiliating!”</p><p class=p1>Jamie, 71, managed<a href=#> his eldest daughter’s conservatorship</a> over her estate and person for 13 years. While Jamie<a href=#> never addressed any alleged wrongdoing</a> in his position as conservator, a judge ultimately<a href=#> ruled to terminate the guardianship</a> in November 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5e%2FqsDNnrBmq6CarrO%2FjKyYsqtdqLWmeceam2aqlauys7%2FEZpyfnpWYwW7AzmaenqyknruoecGoq6iwXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dalvin-cook-bio-age-height-career-wife-children-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dalvin Cook Bio, Age, Height, Career, Wife, Children, Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sofia-vergara-neon-green-swimsuit-italy.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sofia Vergara Glows in a Neon-Green Swimsuit on Italian Holiday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
