As a third-generation fisherman, he developed a passion for the sea from a young age. He accompanied his father Johnathan Sr. on his fishing boat when he was only three years old, and learned how to catch fish by himself when he was seven. He followed his father’s footsteps and started his commercial fishing career at 17, without much interest in formal education. He graduated from Coeur d’Alene High School in Idaho in 1980, but did not pursue any higher studies. Instead, he focused on becoming an expert fisherman, learning from his father and brothers who also worked in the family business. Johnathan was a thrill-seeker who loved taking risks and challenges in his fishing adventures. He also had a passion for riding his Harley and watching sports in his leisure time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Career and Progression</h2><p>From a humble Deckhand to a seasoned Captain, Johnathan has mastered the art of commercial fishing. He honed his skills on the F/V Time Bandit, a 113-foot vessel that his father built in 1991. He chased lobsters along the New England coast for eight years, then switched to the more profitable King Crab in the icy waters of the Bering Sea. He also chased salmon fishing in the summer, when he shared the helm with his younger brother, Andy Hillstrand, who rose from a deck boss to a co-captain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Captain-Johnathan-Hillstrand.jpg><p>Johnathan is not only a fisherman, but also an entrepreneur.

I’ll do it myself …&nbsp;if I come out here again. I’ll kick myself in my own nuts and poke my own eye.”</p><p>However, Johnathan’s retirement did not last long.
