"It became clear to me that many children — even those younger than five — have to deal with complex problems without the emotional resilience, language or confidence to ask for help. And it was also clear that with mental health problems still being such a taboo, many adults are often too afraid to ask for help for the children in their care."</p><p><span>After discussing her hopes for removing the stigma and prejudice surrounding getting help for children's mental health issues, she went on to talk about her own parenting approaches.</span></p><span class=caption></span><p><span>"Like most parents today, William and I would not hesitate to seek help for our children if they needed it," she said. "We hope to encourage George and Charlotte to speak about their feelings, and to give them the tools and sensitivity to be supportive peers to their friends as they get older. We know there is no shame in a young child struggling with their emotions or suffering from a mental illness."</span></p><p><span>It was also announced on Wednesday that Middleton has become patron of the Anna Freud Centre, a children’s mental health charity she <a href=#>visited last year</a>. “The patronage reflects Her Royal Highness’s continued personal interest in children's mental health and emotional wellbeing,” the Palace told <i>Us Weekly</i> in a statement.</span></p><p>You can read the Duchess' full blog <a href=#>here</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSaeq61w52jnqyfo3qxsc2sZJukn5x6sLqMnJ%2BipJSnsq%2B%2FjKacp6yRoXqpscClq6Flp2aDdYKSbmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kim-ng-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kim Ng Net Worth How Much is Kim Ng Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-anthony-davis-injured-the-latest-updates-on-the-lakers-stars-health.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Anthony Davis Injured?
