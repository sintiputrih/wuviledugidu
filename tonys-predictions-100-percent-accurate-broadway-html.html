You could make an argument for each show here, though some productions have edged ahead of others over the course of campaigning: Hell’s Kitchen and The Outsiders are proving themselves as commercial hits; Suffs has become the critical fave; Illinoise is the edgier pick; and Water for Elephants is clinging to that New York Times critics’ pick (also, it has acrobats). Personally, I’d lean Suffs as the most well-made original thing of this crop, but the electric belting and star power of Alicia Keys campaigning hard feels like it’s pushing things in another direction.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxeyxe9q00333b780jkzk6gi@published data-word-count=4><strong>Will win: </strong>Hell’s Kitchen</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxeyxdyu001c3b78phmqnxte@published data-word-count=17><strong>Best Revival of a Musical</strong><br>Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club<br>Gutenberg!

It boils down to a beloved veteran in O’Hara (who also propelled Days of Wine and Roses into existence) and a dazzling newcomer in Moon.

Maybe this is inside baseball, but even though Merrily opened in the fall, it went to the lengths of reinviting Tony voters who’d already seen it in May, so I think Mendez’s richly nuanced work will be fresh on people’s minds.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxeyxe5h001v3b78ficprstb@published data-word-count=4><strong>Will win: </strong>Lindsay Mendez</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxeyxecd003f3b787hoagvcl@published data-word-count=28><strong>Best Book of a Musical</strong><br>Kristoffer Diaz — Hell’s Kitchen<br>Bekah Brunstetter — The Notebook<br>Adam Rapp and Justin Levine — The Outsiders<br>Shaina Taub — Suffs<br>Rick Elice — Water for Elephants</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxeyxe8q00273b78mvjfdo7q@published data-word-count=78>Sometimes, this is an award a front-runner collects based on its own momentum, but while Hell’s Kitchen may be my guess for Best Musical, its book is its generally agreed-upon weak point (it has both an underage sex scare and a confused attempt to justify “Pawn It All”).

Pidgeon may be arguably the lead of Stereophonic, as the show’s Stevie Nicks–alike, and she’s got an incredible voice, to boot, but Young’s comedic genius in Purlie was pretty undeniable. The two have been neck and neck all season, so this may come down to a coin flip, but I’m guessing Young, previously nominated for the past two years (a <a href=#>record for a Black actress</a>), has built up the acclaim and enthusiasm to take it.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxeyxe9m002j3b78jzo37s2s@published data-word-count=4><strong>Will win: </strong>Kara Young</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxeyxe9q00313b78r87xz7gr@published data-word-count=34><strong>Best Scenic Design in a Play</strong><strong><br></strong>dots — Appropriate<br>dots — An Enemy of the People<br>Derek McLane — Purlie Victorious: A Non-Confederate Romp Through the Cotton Patch<br>David Zinn — Jaja’s African Hair Braiding<br>David Zinn — Stereophonic</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxeyxe9l002h3b78k9smv000@published data-word-count=58>A fun category with two pairs of double nominees, and a place where revival and original works face off.
