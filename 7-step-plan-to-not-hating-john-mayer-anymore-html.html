This is despite the fact that Mayer has basically been out of the public eye for three years. He hasn’t done anything to make the situation worse, but he also didn’t really do anything to make the situation better. Apparently, releasing arguably the best two albums of his career was not enough. But we want you to have a chance to enjoy last year’s <i>Born and Raised</i> and the new <i>Paradise Valley</i>, which came out yesterday, without being clouded by images of angry exes or cocky-bastard quotes. So Vulture has devised a seven-point plan to help you move past any residual ill will, chill out, and just listen.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-32bd2f04f08aaf116bc3637157037ae4-3-0-0@published data-word-count=75><b>Step one: Look at his goofy guitar-solo face.<br></b>Yeah, it’s silly and dumb, but don’t we like silly and dumb? At least they’re not sex faces; they’re more like a cross between having to sneeze and joking around with a baby you see on the train. (<a href=#>Here’s more evidence</a>.) The first step to liking John Mayer is thinking of him as less a douchebag bro and more a gangly Muppet. A Muppet maybe named Mohn Jayer?</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-32bd2f04f08aaf116bc3637157037ae4-5-0-0@published data-word-count=123><b>Step two: Learn about his crippling throat problem.<br></b><span>Mohn Jayer hasn’t toured since 2010, largely because of a vocal cord granuloma that not only needed multiple surgeries (including Botox injections) and prevented him from singing, but completely changed “everything” about his voice.

Jayer and CollegeHumor co-founder Ricky Van Veen are friends, Katy Perry and Allison Williams are friends, and all together they make for a fun-looking double dating situation. What do you think they talk about? The Internet? And when they all go out to dinner or the mall, who sits in the back? And while we’re here, Katy Perry’s duet with Jayer on <i>Paradise Valley</i> is kind of really good and they make a lot of sense together.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-32bd2f04f08aaf116bc3637157037ae4-20-0-0@published data-word-count=88><b>Step six: Repeat the words <i>Frank Ocean can’t be wrong, Frank Ocean can never be wrong.<br></i></b><span>Fact: Frank Ocean is a perfect young man with a </span><a href=#>perfect young man’s smile</a><span>.

In a way, over his last two albums, Jayer has become a different artist — one with a new, ailment-altered voice and a songwriting and guitar-playing style that has a lot more to do with actual folk music than the type of turn-of-the-millennium pop-folk he was the biggest star of. </span><i>Paradise Valley</i><span> is Mohn Jayer’s tribute to his Montana home and intentionally conjures the calm and vastness of America’s open spaces. It’s a mellow record (unsurprisingly) for when you’re in a mellow mood, and Jayer gets that’s all it has to be. As </span><a href=#>he told <i>Billboard</i></a><span>, “There’s a time and place for my records. I don’t mind being the guy you call up for this one moment where you appreciate it but you don’t necessarily have to give your life over to it.”</span></p><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cjrljoast004rn5ye0v7kzfzw@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Can You Guess the Real Pilot ABC Ordered Based on a John Mayer Song?</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ambrose-97effb71b9a759b7ea088a9b4a25e568@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>How to Not Hate Gwyneth Paltrow in Iron Man 3</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>7-Step Plan to Not Hating John Mayer Anymore</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobGdgbXx4edKtnKlloKGur3nTqGSnp6RitaLAyKeeZqKfnbtuucCynKtlkaPGrrvRnmWhrJ2h</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./america-fuck-yeah-lyrics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>America Fuck Yeah Lyrics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ramy-youssef.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ramy Youssef Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts, Career, Single</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
