The model shares her secrets with Us Weekly—dishing on 25 things you don’t know about her.<br>&nbsp;<br>1.My friends and I used to wear jeans under our Amish clothes when we were at home so our parents wouldn't see them. But as soon as we were down the road a little, we would take our dresses off and walk around in regular street clothes.<br>&nbsp;<br>2. I have over 300 cousins and step cousins all over the US. With no electricity, the Amish keep themselves busy in a lot of ways.</p><p>3. I had a hidden radio growing up, and would sneak out to listen to<a title=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrities/eminem href=#> <strong>Eminem</strong></a> all the time. I dreamt of becoming a rapper and would rap under my breath when I was alone, so if modeling doesn’t work out…<br>&nbsp;<br>4. Our Amish church services were so long, my friends and I would pretend we had to go to the bathroom just so wecould take a break from the hard benches.<br>&nbsp;<br>5. I love the smell of hairspray. I would use it as air freshener if I could—but that probably wouldn't be good.<br>&nbsp;<br>6. I believe Nutella and Popcorn should each be their own food group on the pyramid. I’m addicted to Nutella!<br>&nbsp;<br>7. I broke my nose trying to train a very stubborn pony. All I remember was seeing him fly over me and the pain afterwards.<br>&nbsp;<br>8.My celebrity crush is <a href=#><strong>Zac Efron</strong></a>. You don’t see abs like that out in the country.<br>&nbsp;<br>9. I was the biggest troublemaker and tomboy growing up. I loved doing everything the boys did—my brother broke his legs once trying to keep up.<br>&nbsp;<br>10<a href=#>.<strong>Victoria Beckham</strong></a> is my idol and fashion icon. I even named my puppy after her.</p><p>11. I love dance and music. I do a lot of mirror practicing and move bustin’ at home.</p><p>12. I love designing and sewing; I made my first dress at 9 years old. I make a lot of my own dresses and scarves, mostly everything you see me wearing I’ve handmade myself in my apartment.<br>&nbsp;<br>13. I live in NYC but I still don’t have a television at home. Although I enjoy the occasional movie, I’d rather go out and do things myself than watch others do them on TV. Old habits die hard.<br>&nbsp;<br>14.I’m OCD with my teeth. I carry a portable toothbrush everywhere I go.<br>&nbsp;<br>15. You’d think growing up on a farm would prepare me for almost anything, but my first encounter with an NYC ratreally tested my skills. With a little stealth, I managed to catch it with my bare hands. (Eww!)<br>&nbsp;<br>16. I owned a bakery in Amish country, before I moved to New York. It’s still there at the care of my mom and sister. My best-selling item was my grandmother's apple dumplings.<br>&nbsp;<br>17. My grandfather used to call me 'kitkat' and would always have Amish candy for me, but now that I’m living with the “English” KitKats are my favorite sweet.<br>&nbsp;<br>18. There wasn’t much to do back home, so I read every book in the town library at least twice. I have that to thank for being an A student.<br>&nbsp;<br>19. My breakfast routine is highly predictable. I almost always have two eggs and a coffee.<br>&nbsp;<br>20. I love singing and used to sing soprano in the Sunday group.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>21. I'm a basket case, literally. I organize my drawers and closets with them obsessively.<br>&nbsp;<br>22. I'm very spiritual, and believe in surrounding myself only with people that have good energy or make me want to improve myself.<br>&nbsp;<br>23. I walk very quietly and often unintentionally scare people that don't hear me approach.<br>&nbsp;<br>24. I love wearing stilettos and dressing up. It adds another level of confidence when you feel good about how you look.<br>&nbsp;<br>25. I write a new inspirational message on my bathroom mirror (with lipstick) every time I clean, then read it every morning while getting ready for the day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSaerTAzqWrs2Vianq1tMinnqxlqaTCbrDOp6tmo56kxG6twaisrWWdmnpzfJBtaW9uXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nathan-bound-who-is-he-missing-update.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nathan Bound | Who Is He | Missing Update</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./95161-jessa-duggar-shares-photos-beloved-boys-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jessa Duggar shares photos of her two beloved little boys</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
