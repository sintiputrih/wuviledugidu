Further reading Front-wheel drive refers to a car in which the transmission sends the engine’s power to the front wheels. Rear-wheel drive is the opposite; the engine spins the rear wheels. Four- and all-wheel drive cars have power at all four corners.</description></item><item><title>Input Lag, Power Use and Color Gamut</title><link>/monoprice-zerog-slim-27-ips-monitor-review.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/monoprice-zerog-slim-27-ips-monitor-review.html</guid><description>Once again, there isn’t a good lag tester on the market that can do 2560x1440 natively.
