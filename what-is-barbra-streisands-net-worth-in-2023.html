She released her debut album, The Barbra Streisand Album, in 1963, and it quickly hit the Billboard charts, going gold.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=531 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>Since then, she has reached iconic status, starring in many classic films of the day. From Funny Girl to The Way We Were, Streisand has lent her talent to films that continue to stand the test of time. A Star Is Born, in particular, remains so relevant that it has been remade three times. Streisand’s version, with country star Kris Kristofferson, was the second remake before one of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lady Gaga’s best performances</a> in the follow-up. The first version came out in 1937, followed by the one in 1954 that starred Judy Garland.</p><p data-characters=518 data-current-count=518 data-injectable=true>Streisand’s accomplishments have earned her place in pop culture’s permanent zeitgeist — and a well-deserved lifetime achievement award. At the 2024 SAG Awards, the union honored the long-standing performer for her six-plus decades in the entertainment industry. A director, singer, and now <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">memoirist</a>, Streisand is a beloved part of this thing we call show business. She delivered a moving speech to an emotional crowd, thanking the union for their performances and calling back to her origins (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety</a>).</p><p>“I can’t believe it. I remember dreaming of being an actress as a teenager, sitting in my bed in Brooklyn with a pint of coffee ice cream and a movie magazine.”</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Despite her mother’s urgings to pursue typing as a way to make money, Streisand didn’t listen and sure enough, a star was born. Thus, with a resume brimming with award-winning films, her net worth can only be as impressive as the star herself.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-barbra-streisand-s-net-worth data-injectable=false>What is Barbra Streisand’s net worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/barbra-2.png><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true>Unsurprisingly, Streisand’s record, movie sales, and tours have pushed her into a high-earning bracket. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, her current net worth is estimated at $400 million. It almost seems unfair that someone can be so talented, but in this regard, she deserves her earnings.</p><p data-characters=616 data-current-count=616 data-injectable=true>On the other hand, she also knows how to spend it. In her home with her husband, James Brolin, Streisand has achieved something that people often dream of. An avid fan of shopping, the star built her own shopping mall in the basement of her house. In a conversation with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Harper’s Bazaar</a>, Streisand explained what makes her mall so special. Curated to look like turn-of-the-century antique stores, the Funny Girl actor populated its stores with gifts, sweets, and vintage clothes. Though it may appear to be an embarrassment of wealth, Streisand admittedly has a practical reason for having a mall in her own house.</p><p data-characters=585 data-current-count=585 data-injectable=true>“Instead of just storing my things in the basement, I can make a street of shops and display them,” Streisand said. Creating this scene is more of a hobby, of which she has a few. She is also known for designing houses on her massive property. She created a makeshift village that includes a mansion and a barn that houses many treasures. These houses are design projects, which get her devoted time since money is not a problem for the Yentl star. Having this hobby also means that she and Brolin don’t have to leave the property when the couple wants to go on vacation.</p><p data-characters=222 data-current-count=222 data-injectable=false>“We treat the barn like a B&B,” Streisand said, “as if we went away for the weekend, but we don’t have to drive.” As far as the performer’s finances go, there are worse ways to spend your money.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZKWv6O%2BwGaqraqVnsCiusOsZKedpGLEsL7ToWSipl1nfXN%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alienware-announces-aw3418dw-and-aw3418hw-ultrawide-curved-displays.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alienware Announces AW3418DW and AW3418HW Ultra-Wide Curved Displays</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./shayan-munshi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-498152-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Shayan Munshi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
