Curious about who inherited his money? It's pretty revealing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Hugh Hefner himself once said, "It's good to be selfish, but not so self-centered that you never listen to other people." But one of the things we'll learn about Hefner in A&E's new docuseries <a href=#>Secrets of Playboy</a>, is that he rarely listened to other people, especially if they were saying no. The pajama-clad media mogul died almost five years ago, leaving a sizable fortune (and more than one child) behind. Who inherited all of his money, and what can we expect from this docuseries?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who inherited Hugh Hefner's money?</h2><p>Hugh Hefner was somehow only married three times in his long life, and was still with his third wife, <a href=#>Crystal Hefner</a>, when he died in September 2017. He left behind four children from his first two marriages, a decent chunk of money, and a tarnished legacy (we'll get to this in a minute). In 2013, while married to Crystal, he bought her a $5 million house in the Hollywood Hills that's all concrete and angles. Aesthetically, it looked like a very posh prison.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Crystal Hefner</p></figure><p>While the two lived together in the Playboy Mansion, he apparently wanted to make sure she was taken care of after he died. Despite rumors of a prenuptial agreement leaving her nothing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> reported that Crystal was left $5 million and the house. Speaking of the house, Crystal sold it for a whopping, you guessed it, $5 million in 2019.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortune</a>, the Playboy Mansion was sold to Hefner's neighbor Daren Metropoulos for $100 million in August 2016 before he died. At the time of his death, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a> claimed that Hefner held 35% of the Playboy brand, owned the magazine, and had $36 million worth of stocks and bonds. He also had $6 million in a joint account with a mysteriously unnamed person. His estate was divided up between his four children who sold its shares for about $35 million, which was split with Crystal.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>*sees people talking about Hugh Hefner being an exploitative monster*</p><p>*searches to see what this is all about*</p><p>...ðŸ˜¯</p><p>... guess Hef's sophisticated, gentlemanly demeanor was nothing but a facade</p>â€” Jim Bevan (@JimBevan85) <a href=#>January 24, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter/@JimBevan85</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Hefner's money couldn't keep his abusive behavior a secret.</h2><p>The new 10-part A&E docuseries <a href=#>Secrets of Playboy</a> takes us into the twisted side of Hugh Hefner that no amount of money could keep buried. Primarily narrated by former Director of Playmate Promotions Miki Garcia, ex-girlfriend and Playmate Sondra Theodore, and "Bunny Mother" PJ Masten (who managed female staffers at the Playboy nightclubs), we're introduced to a man who some called a "monster."</p><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a> for the series, Hefner's former executive assistant Lisa Loving Barrett disclosed the fact that quaaludes (a sedative) were referred to as the "leg spreader" and were a "necessary evil" at the mansion. Several people, including Lisa and Hefner, had prescriptions in their names so the drug would be readily available at all times. They even kept a calendar so they could remember whose turn it was to refill their prescription. What a disgusting nightmare.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: A&E</span><p>Lisa Loving Barrett</p></figure><p>The series also digs deeper into some shocking allegations around coercion, women being forced to have sex with Hefner and his friends, brutal orgies, and even bestiality. It features archival soundbites from Hefner himself, set against anecdotes from former employees. All in all, in paints a picture of a man who convinced the world that these women were being empowered, while he was quietly taking their power from them behind closed doors.</p><p>Secrets of Playboy premieres Monday, Jan. 24 at 9:00 p.m. EST on A&E.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecinn56qmamypXnHrp6hZZias6%2Bx0axkpqeemsY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./frank-vallelonga-jr-green-book-actor-found-dead-60-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Green Book Actor Frank Vallelonga Jr. Found Dead on Street at 60</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./greatest-songs-based-on-historical-events.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>12 Of The Greatest Songs Based On Historical Events</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
