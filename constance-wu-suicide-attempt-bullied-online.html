"I felt awful about what I'd said, and when a few DMs from a fellow Asian actress told me I'd become a blight on the Asian American community, I started feeling like I didn't even deserve to live anymore. That I was a disgrace to AsAms, and they'd be better off without me."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The comments she referred to were those she made when her show, Fresh Off the Boat, was renewed for a sixth season. "So upset right now that I'm literally crying. Ugh. Fuck," she tweeted, followed by, "Fucking hell," less than an hour after ABC made the announcement. And when a fan congratulated her on the renewal, calling it "great news," she replied, "No it's not."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wu later explained that she was upset because she had to give up another project that she was "passionate about" to do the show for the sixth season. At the time of its release, FOTB was the first Asian American comedy on broadcast television in two decades, so her negative reaction to it upset many in the community.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The social media hate she received from those tweets, Wu said today, completely consumed her, and even led to many of her Asian American colleagues avoiding her or cutting her off.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"AsAms don't talk about mental health enough," Wu wrote. "While we're quick to celebrate representation wins, there's a lot of avoidance around the more uncomfortable issues within our community."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wu said she became so depressed that she tried to commit suicide. "Looking back, it's surreal that a few DMs convinced me to end my own life, but that's what happened. Luckily, a friend found me and rushed me to the ER," the actress wrote. "It was a scary moment that made me reassess a lot in my life. For the next few years, I put my career aside to focus on my mental health."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In the post, Wu went on to address the importance of working on one's mental health and getting help when one's thoughts or emotions seem to take control of one's actions. She also shared information for the National Suicide Prevention Hotline.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Now, "after a little break from Hollywood and a lot of therapy," Wu said she feels ready to jump back on social media, reenter Hollywood, and make movies again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The actress is currently the lead in East Bay and stars in The Terminal List and upcoming film Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile. She also recently wrote a memoir, Making a Scene, set to be released later this year. Wu said she wrote her book "to reach out and help people talk about the uncomfortable stuff in order to understand it, reckon with it, and open pathways to healing."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/49ca5303-a74f-4d73-a0f8-6a94e1338358_1714666618.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" title="Headshot of Rosa Sanchez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Rosa Sanchez is the senior news editor at Harper's Bazaar, working on news as it relates to entertainment, fashion, and culture.
