Four new men were also added to the bunch. Luckily, she was able to find love.</p><p>The cast of 35 men was pared down to just one: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zac Clark</a>. He and Tayshia <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">are now happily engaged</a>.</p><p>Here’s who didn’t make the cut.</p><h3>Ben Smith</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Ben-smith-the-bachelorette-1.jpg alt="Ben Smith " width=300 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Ben knew he messed up when Tayshia sent him home before he was able to tell her that he loved her. So after the fantasy suite dates, he came back. He made it through the rose ceremony and into the final two and even met Tayshia’s family. But he couldn’t compete with the love she had for Zac. Ben took the second breakup as well as he could have, telling Tayshia he wants her to be happy.</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ivan Hall</a></h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ivan-hall-the-bachelorette.jpg alt="Ivan Hall" width=300 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Ivan was one of Tayshia’s top three men. He enjoyed a cameras-free fantasy&nbsp;suite date with her. They stayed up the entire night talking, and at some point, religion came up. Viewers weren’t privy to the details of the discussion, but it solidified to Tayshia that their future couldn’t work. (She’s a Christian, and Ivan’s religion is unknown.) During the second-to-last rose ceremony, she sent him home.&nbsp;</p><h3><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brendan Morais</a></h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Brendan-the-bachelorette.jpg alt=Brendan width=300 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>After their first one-on-one early on in the season, Tayshia thought Brendan was the one for her. Like her, he’d been married and divorced before, and understood the gravity of getting married again. But as the engagement loomed, Brendan realized he wasn’t ready to propose to anyone.</p><p>“I want to give you my heart, but as I sit here today my heart is not whole. You deserve a man who is healed from his past and unfortunately, right now I’m not that man,” he told Tayshia, breaking up with her.</p><h3>Ben Smith</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Ben-smith-the-bachelorette.jpg alt="Ben Smith " width=300 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Though Ben was closed up and stuck in his head, he made great strides with Tayshia and learned to be vulnerable. But when it came time to tell Tayshia that he loved her, Ben chickened out. She sent him home before he could tell her how he felt. It was a heartbreaking goodbye.</p><p>At the end of the first part of the finale, Ben came back to tell Tayshia that he’s in love with her.</p><h3>Bake Moynes&nbsp;</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/blake-the-bachelorette.jpg alt=Blake width=300 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Blake had finally gotten a one-on-one with Tayshia. But with hometowns looming, it was too late for them to build a relationship. She sent him home mid-date.</p><h3>Riley</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Riley-the-bachelorette.jpg alt=Riley width=300 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Like Blake, Riley and Tayshia’s relationship just wasn’t far enough along for her to meet his family. Not wanting to put him through a rose ceremony, she sent him home quickly.</p><h3>Noah</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Noah-the-bachelorette.jpg alt=Noah width=300 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Noah had been involved in almost every house drama since he arrived. Their relationship just wasn’t serious enough to continue.</p><h3>Bennett</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Bennett-the-bachelorette.jpg alt=Bennett width=300 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Bougie Bennett had been cut the week before, but decided to come back and tell Tayshia that he loves her. She allowed him to stay for the rose ceremony but axed him again there.</p><h3>Spencer</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/spencer-the-bachelorette.jpg alt=Spencer width=322 height=483 sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>So much for that first impression rose. Spencer is the first contestant to get the much-coveted flower and not make it into final four in several seasons. Tayshia sent him home.</p><h3>Demar</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/demar-the-bachelorette.jpg alt=Demar width=322 height=483 sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>This 26-year-old spin instructor wasn’t the right fit for Tayshia, but he’s a shoo-in for “Bachelor in Paradise.” See you this summer Demar!</p><h3>Ed</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ed-the-bachelorette.jpg alt=Ed width=322 height=483 sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Ed had a busy time on “The Bachelorette.” He had drinks with Chris Harrison at 2 a.m. He battled Chasen. He pretended to be the dad to a baby doll named Carlos. But he just wasn’t right for Tayshia.</p><h3>Eazy</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/eazy-the-bachelorette-tayshia.jpg alt=Eazy width=322 height=472 sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Eazy come, easy go. Tayshia sacked the former NFL player after he revealed he was falling in love with her during a one-on-one date. She didn’t feel the same way and felt that it wasn’t fair to lead him on.&nbsp;</p><h3>Joe</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/155352_1984_v2.jpg alt='THE BACHELORETTE - ABC&#39;s "The Bachelorette" stars Joe. (ABC/Craig Sjodin)' width=322 height=483 sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The 36-year-old New York City anesthesiologist serenaded Tayshia on the guitar in a deleted scene in Week 6, but didn’t manage to make a connection. He sure won Twitter’s heart, though. Internet fans hope he’ll be a future Bachelor.</p><h3>Chasen</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/155352_0619_v2.jpg alt='THE BACHELORETTE - ABC&#39;s "The Bachelorette" stars Chasen. (ABC/Craig Sjodin)' width=322 height=483 sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>After his embarrassing bro-off with fellow himbo Ed in Week 6 and his regrettable use of the word “Smokeshow” to describe Tayshia, the 31-year-old San Diegan somehow just didn’t make the cut. Can’t imagine why.</p><h3>Kenny</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/155352_2225.jpg alt='ABC&#39;s "The Bachelorette" stars Kenny. ' width=322 height=483 sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The boy band manager, 39, surprisingly didn’t get a rose after the serenade portion of Week 7 and was sent home later that episode.</p><h3>Jordan C.</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/155352_1766_v2.jpg alt='ABC&#39;s "The Bachelorette" stars Jordan C. ' width=322 height=483 sizes="(max-width: 322px) 100vw, 322px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>The 26-year-old software account exec from NYC didn’t exactly woo Tayshia by complimenting her “big ass eyes” and was sent home.</p><h3>Montel</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Montel-the-bachelorette.jpg alt=Montel width=291 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 291px) 100vw, 291px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Montel had been brought on at the start of Tayshia’s reign to give her more options. But the two didn’t click. She sent the 30-year-old gym owner back to Boston.</p><h3>Peter</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Peter-the-bachelorette.jpg alt=peter width=294 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><br>Peter was also one of the newer men, and also from Massachusetts. The 32-year-old real estate agent wasn’t a match for Tayshia.</p><h3>Jay</h3><h3><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Jay-the-bachelorette.jpg alt=Jay width=301 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></h3><p>Jay owns his own personal training center. But he wasn’t fit for Tayshia, who sent the 29-year-old Floridan back home.</p><h3>Jason</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Jason-the-bachelorette.jpg alt="jason " width=301 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 301px) 100vw, 301px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Jason had a hard time adjusting to having a new woman on set. He came for Clare, not Tayshia. It was especially difficult after he and Clare bonded on a special one-on-one date during the second episode. He opened up to her and she chose another man. Jason decided to tell Tayshia he was “in love” with Clare and couldn’t be there for her, and left the resort on his own.</p><h3>Dale Moss</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Ben-smith-the-bachelorette-1.jpg><p>Clare knew Dale was her man right <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">when he stepped out of the limo</a>: “I think I just met my husband,” she told Chris Harrison.</p><p>She was right: Only four weeks in, Crawley rejected all the other men to focus on Dale. The former football player got down on one knee, and she said yes.</p><p>He left the La Quinta with Clare in tow.</p><h3>Yosef Aborady</h3><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/bachelorette-57.jpg alt=Yosef. width=315 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Bad boy Yosef had enough of Clare’s “immaturity.” Angry that she had asked the men give her more attention and had others strip down during a game of dodgeball, he confronted her about her “tasteless” and “classless” behavior. “I’m ashamed to be associated with you,” the 30-year-old medical-device salesman yelled. Clare kicked him out on the spot.</p><p>Though that’s the last we’ll see of Yosef on “The Bachelorette,” rumors are swirling on TikTok about his off-screen behavior as well.</p><h3>Zach J.</h3><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/bachelorette-58.jpg alt="Zach J." width=315 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Zach J. headed to the spa with Clare for his one-one-one date. But they fumbled when they tried to kiss: he thought she was pulling away, she thought he was pulling away, so he grabbed her arm, she felt uncomfortable. Clare had Chris Harrison dismiss him for her.</p><h3>Garin</h3><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/bachelorette-55.jpg alt=Garin width=315 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Though the press was rooting for Garin (he’s a journalism professor!), the poor sap didn’t get any air time. The 34-year-old did not get a rose.</p><h3>Blake</h3><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/bachelorette-54.jpg alt="Blake Monar" width=315 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Male grooming specialist Blake Monar, 31, wasn’t the right fit for Clare. Now Blake Moynes remains as the season’s sole Blake.</p><h3>Tyler S.</h3><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/bachelorette-56.jpg alt=Tyler width=315 height=441 sizes="(max-width: 315px) 100vw, 315px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Tyler S., we hardly knew ye. The music manager was the season’s last Tyler, leaving us Tyler-less until next time.</p><h3>Brandon</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/ivan-hall-the-bachelorette.jpg><p>After winning a game of strip dodgeball to get time with Clare, Brandon was ready to tell her how he felt. The Ohio real estate agent said he signed up for the show when Clare was announced as the Bachelorette. But aside from her looks, he couldn’t name one thing he liked about her. So Clare kicked him to the curb on the spot. Because the episode ended before the second rose ceremony, Brandon was the only gent sent packing during week 2.</p><h3>Tyler C.</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/Tyler-C-the-Bachelorette-who-went-home.jpg alt="Tyler C. smiles wide, despite causing drama on the first night of the show." width=300 height=450 sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p>Tyler C. (not to be confused with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bachelor Nation favorite Tyler C.</a>) came to the cocktail party armed with information about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">contestant Yosef</a>. He tried to warn Clare about Yosef’s flirty DMs to other girls. His plan backfired and got him sent home, while Yosef will live to fight another week.</p><h3>AJ</h3><p><a class=aligncenter href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/AJ-the-Bachelorette-who-went-home.jpg alt='AJ of season 16 of "The Bachelorette."
