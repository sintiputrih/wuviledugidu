But Angel won something ‚Äî an affiliation with Shaq.</p>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jhDJkI eZknfg">Jamie Lerner</a><p class="sc-ensa-Dq fPmIpI">Apr. 2 2024, Published 3:44 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@angelreese10</a></figure><p>The biggest game of March Madness in 2024 was the highly anticipated matchup between the <a href=#>LSU Tigers</a> and the Iowa Hawkeyes in the women‚Äôs NCAA tournament. Each team featured a rising basketball star ‚Äî <a href=#>Angel Reese</a> with LSU and <a href=#>Caitlin Clark</a> with Iowa. And the game was a rematch of the 2023 national championship game, which LSU won.</p><p>After that, Angel began spending a lot of time with another <a href=#>basketball legend</a>, <a href=#>Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal</a>. In March 2024, Shaq escorted Angel at the LSU women‚Äôs basketball senior day ceremony. Considering his Hall of Famer status and household name recognition, many are wondering if he and Angel are actually related. So what‚Äôs the truth?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@angelreese10</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Is Angel Reese related to Shaq?</h2><p>Although Angel and Shaq seem to be quite close, they‚Äôre not related in any known way. But their shared bond likely comes from their shared history. Shaq is also an LSU alum from the ‚Äò90s before becoming a world-famous <a href=#>NBA</a> player, so he frequently attends LSU games and outings. He and Angel first met at an LSU football game, after which they grew closer in a mentor-mentee type of relationship.</p><p>When Shaq‚Äôs daughter Me‚ÄôArah visited LSU as a potential college option in February 2023, she stayed with Angel, which kickstarted Angel‚Äôs relationship with Shaq further. While Angel was excited to rapport with a legend, Shaq was looking to sign more female athletes to Reebok, so he challenged her. ‚ÄúBet you can‚Äôt get 20 and 20,‚Äù he said. And Angel got 23 points and 26 rebounds in a win against Mississippi State. After that, their mentorship was inevitable.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dynamic Double-Double Duo</p><p>Angel Reese (25) and Aneesah Morrow (21) are the only teammates in the nation to both have 20+ double-doubles üî• <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/Lwb0lK5szS</a></p>‚Äî LSU Women's Basketball (@LSUwbkb) <a href=#>March 27, 2024</a></figure><p>In April 2023, Angel lead LSU to victory in the NCAA tournament and won herself the title of NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player. After she became a household name to most sports fans, Shaq gave her some much needed advice. "He just said, people are gonna hate me, people are not gonna like me, people are gonna feel some type of way because they wish they were me, they‚Äôre gonna judge me," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">USA Today</a>.</p><p>"He‚Äôs super inspiring to me," she added of her relationship to Shaq, whom she called a "father figure" as well. "He‚Äôs so genuine, he‚Äôs been there for me through tough times. He just gets it, and there‚Äôs not a more perfect person for me to be tight with. We have fun, and if I need anything, he would help me ‚Ä¶ and he would do that even if I never played basketball again. He doesn‚Äôt care about me as a player, he cares about me as a person."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Angel Reese and Shaq have a lot of similarities.</h2><p>Not only did Angel and Shaq both go to LSU, but they have similar reputations on and off the court. This could explain how their mentorship grew so close and why Angel invited him to escort her at a ceremony typically reserved for families. LSU assistant coach Bob Starkey is one fo the few people to have worked with both Angel and Shaq.</p><p>"There‚Äôs really strong parallels in their personalities," Bob said. "They love people, they welcome the spotlight that comes with stardom, they both have a great love for this school and an enthusiasm for life." And while both have been <a href=#>in the face of controversy</a>, they are at different points in their careers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>While Shaq builds up Angel‚Äôs image through her partnerships and encourages her to be genuine but smart, Angel is still building up her professional basketball career. LSU‚Äôs loss to Iowa was definitely a roadblock, but with Shaq in Angel‚Äôs corner, we doubt it‚Äôs the last we‚Äôll see of her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBurc2gnKVlopqytLGMq5ylmaSasW7AzmaqoZmh</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dee-dee-benkie-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dee Dee Benkie Net Worth (Updated 2022) Earnings, Salary</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-gutierrez-guatemala-hoodie.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Chris Gutierrez &amp;quot;Guatemala&amp;quot; Hoodie | Fan Arch</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
