Eggert, in a since-deleted tweet reported on by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>, wrote that curious parties should “ask @scottbaio what happened in his garage at his house” when she was underage, vaguely elaborating that the behavior in question started when she was 14 years old.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-accusations-did-nicole-eggert-level-at-scott-baio data-injectable=false>What accusations did Nicole Eggert level at Scott Baio?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=382 data-current-count=682 data-injectable=true>Baio fired back, claiming that the allegations were entirely made up, and went so far as to claim that he and his legal team had shut down Eggert’s previous attempts to disparage his name by threatening legal action against the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Oz</a> show when Eggert was scheduled to make an appearance. Eggert, for her part, doubled down with a spot on Megyn Kelly Today a few days later.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>During the interview, Eggert claimed that she was abused by Baio “about once a week” when she was between the ages of 14 and 16 and he was in his 20s. She detailed instances of being touched inappropriately and claimed that fellow members of the cast of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles in Charge</a> had witnessed fondling and kissing on set when she was underage. Eggert went on to repeat her previous assertion that she had lost her virginity to Baio when she was 17.</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=249 data-injectable=false>Explaining why she hadn’t come forward with her story before, Eggert explained that “(…)it was always protecting the show and protecting that whole legacy — that nothing happened. That was my delusion and that was my cover-up, always.”</p><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=592 data-injectable=true>Baio, meanwhile, continued to deny any wrongdoing, stating that, like all good guys, he waited until the child he’d been working with for years had turned 18 before getting intimate with her. Furthermore, he remained steadfast in his recollection that Eggert had seduced him, showing up at his house after Charles in Charge was off the air.</p><p data-characters=427 data-current-count=427 data-injectable=false>He alleged that Eggert had made her claims in a shot at cheap publicity, which would seem like a bold assertion if it wasn’t coming from a guy who actively promoted Sandy Hook conspiracy theories on social media. Eggert went on to state that she’d been advised of legal options, including a possible liable suit thanks to Baio’s claims that she had lied about the whole affair. As of 2024, no legal action has been taken.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S7qq%2FOpZxmnZecsrPA0maqnrCllrlurcGuqp5lkaG5prPAraCopqNirqityKeqrWWTna6zuMSsZKKmXZi1or7GnmScp12owaK%2BjKyaqKykYq%2Bitc5mnLGonJa2r7HDaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anirban-lahiri.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anirban Lahiri</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./michele-hicks.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Michele Hicks - Bio, Age, Net Worth, Height, Facts, Married</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
