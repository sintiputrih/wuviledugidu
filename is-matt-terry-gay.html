His debut album, Trouble debuted on November 24, 2017, peaked at number 29 on the UK Albums Chart.</p><p>However, as he gears up to promote his latest single, “You Don’t Know Nothing,” after a four-year hiatus, the spotlight has shifted back to his personal life.</p><p>In particular, speculation about his sexuality, with many wondering if he is gay, has been a topic of interest. In this article, we’ll delve into the details and seek to uncover the truth about Matt Terry’s sexual orientation.</p><p><span><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Mike Posner Gay? “I Want to Have S*x with Men and Women,” Says American Singer!</a></strong></span></p><h2>Is Matt Terry Gay?</h2><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.therconline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Celebrity-Social-Network-Photos.webp alt="is matt terry gay" width=928 height=617 sizes="(max-width: 928px) 100vw, 928px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>No, Matt Terry is not gay.&nbsp;</strong>The rumors surrounding Matt Terry’s sexuality sent shockwaves through the internet, especially after an incident where he was alleged to have kissed his friend Freddy shortly after his X Factor victory.</p><p>However, Matt wasted no time in setting the record straight. In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Metro</a>, he candidly confirmed, <strong>“I’m heterosexual.”</strong></p><p>He went on to express his genuine affection for Freddy, emphasizing that their connection was purely spiritual and not romantic: “I love Freddy to pieces. We hit it off from the beginning. We’re just really close. We didn’t kiss on stage.”</p><p>Matt Terry has maintained a refreshingly open-minded perspective when it comes to these speculations about his sexuality. In his words:</p><p>“It doesn’t bother me – who cares? If you like a boy, you like a boy, if you like a girl, you like a girl, if you like both, you like both… it’s 2016.”</p><p>He also emphasized that there are far more important things to worry about than someone’s sexual orientation, and he takes no offense in being labeled otherwise.</p><p>Despite the rumors, Matt’s living arrangement with Freddy raised more questions. Freddy eventually <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">moved back to his hometown</a> in 2017, but that hasn’t stopped fans from speculating about Matt’s sexuality.</p><p>Nevertheless, Matt has consistently maintained that he is heterosexual. In an interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">OK! magazine</a>, he even chuckled at the persistent gay rumors.</p><p>His track record of dating women in the past stands as a testament to his straight sexual orientation, putting the speculation to rest.</p><p><span><strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Is Pedro Pascal Gay?
