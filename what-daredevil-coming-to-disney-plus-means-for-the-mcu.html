Other franchises are great in their own right, but what Marvel has done with the MCU is truly astounding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the MCU was off and running, the Marvel Netflix universe got underway. <a href=#>Some shows were better than others</a>, but overall, it was an amazing universe. The Netflix shows and shows like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. are coming to Disney Plus, and this news has huge implications for the MCU, namely with its <a href=#>looming threats and future projects</a>.</p><p>Let's look at how this announcement is changing everything for the MCU.</p><h2 id=what-does-39-daredevil-39-mean-for-disney-and-marvel>What Does 'Daredevil' Mean For Disney+ And Marvel?</h2><p>April 2015 marked a huge moment for Marvel fans, as Daredevil made its ways onto Netflix and finally gave the world a good project featuring Matt Murdock.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring Charlie Cox as the titular hero, Daredevil was everything that comic book fans were hoping to see. It did a great job with its characters, its story, and its overall execution. The action scenes were fantastic, and Cox's lead performance was instrumental in everything coming together perfectly.</p><p>Thanks to the success of Daredevil, Netflix got the ball rolling on the own Marvel universe. Shows like Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Punisher, and more all played a part in the overarching story growing. No, these shows weren't always perfect (looking at you, Iron Fist), but there is no denying that they were exceptional as a whole.</p><p>Considering that this universe was going on during some of the MCU's best years, questions lingered about its connection to the big screen franchise. After all, we didn't hear Tony Stark ever mention the Devil of Hell's Kitchen, despite being fully aware of a young kid from Queens who could stop a bus with his bare hands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thankfully, some major events have shaken things up for the better.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Worst MCU Series On Disney+, According To IMDb</a></span></p><h2 id=daredevil-made-his-mcu-debut-in-39-spider-man-no-way-home-39>Daredevil Made His MCU Debut In 'Spider-Man: No Way Home'</h2><p>In Spider-Man: No Way Home, fans were stunned to see the debut of Charlie Cox's Daredevil early on in the movie. The Man Without Fear didn't step up to Spidey's rogues gallery in the movie, but his presence alone was huge for the franchise.</p><p>When talking about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">appearing in the movie</a> and the road he took to get there, Cox said, "It was a pretty surreal moment, I’m not going to lie. Bear in mind that it’s been a few years. And I was pretty convinced it was over. Kevin said, ‘We’ve got some ideas, but I wanted to make sure that you, in principle, are interested.’ And I was like, ‘I’m very interested.’ And then I didn’t hear from anyone for two months. And I got to the point where I wondered if I dreamt it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was no dream, and Cox's Daredevil being in the movie changed everything in the blink of an eye. This wasn't the only major surprise that Marvel had up its sleeve for Phase Four.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin debuted on Hawkeye, and MCU fans were able to start connecting the dots about how these characters fit into the greater scheme of things.</p><p>These two cameos stole headlines, and a recent announcement has MCU fans in a frenzy once again.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which Stars Are Joining The MCU In 'Thor: Love and Thunder'?</a></span></p><h2 id=daredevil-is-no-longer-a-variant-character>Daredevil Is No Longer A Variant Character</h2><p>Recently, it was announced that the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix Marvel shows were making their way to Disney Plus</a>, joining shows like WandaVision and Loki.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, what does this mean? Simply put, this means that the Daredevil and Kingpin we saw weren't just variants. Rather, they are now already-established characters who have effectively expanded the MCU.</p><p>Marvel is currently building up to a number of major conflicts, and the MCU is not solely focused on one huge threat.</p><p>Thanks to Eternals, we have Arishem's judgment looming. Loki let us know that Kang and his legion of variants are also going to be a problem down the line. And lastly, after the events of Hawkeye and the inclusion of the Netflix shows on Disney Plus, Kingpin is now a major problem for street-level heroes.</p><p>The cosmic and multiversal problems are undoubtedly going to dominate the big screen, but now, we have street-level conflicts that can give the small screen a rich, interconnected story. This will keep fans happy, and it will keep droves of new subscribers flocking to Disney Plus, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'TWD' Star Norman Reedus Is Rumoured To Play Ghost Rider In The MCU</a></span></p><p>There is no better time to be a fan of Marvel than right now.
