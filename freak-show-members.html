They were considered medical marvels — especially since they had almost completely separate bodies save for a small, four-inch bridge of flesh that connected them.</p><p>Hunter immediately saw an opportunity to make a profit. He tracked down the twins’ mother, and paid her $500 to exhibit her children as a curiosity on a tour of the world as “The Siamese Twins.”</p><p>The brothers toured for three years, doing backflips and playing badminton for enthusiastic audiences. While they were a very popular act, they barely saw any money from their performances and were often treated like property rather than people while they were working with Hunter.</p><p>Tired of the exploitation, the brothers ended their contract with Hunter once they turned 21. For years afterward, they ran a show of their own, where they were able to earn their own money and perform on their own terms.</p><p>Still, they didn’t like being gawked at and quit performing in freak shows and circus performances altogether. They decided to become American citizens and bought a plantation in North Carolina.</p><p>But even though they were through with being exploited, this didn’t stop them from running their plantation off the backs of enslaved people. The brothers owned 18 slaves, many of whom had been bought as children.</p><p>Eventually, Chang and Eng Bunker married a pair of sisters — and they soon started families. Between the two of them, they <a href=# rel=noopener>fathered 21 children</a>.</p><p>But things began to go downhill for them after the Civil War. They had invested a fortune into the Confederate States of America — which obviously did not pay off. The brothers ended up bankrupt, with Chang taking the news especially hard. He began drinking heavily and suffered a stroke in 1870.</p><p>In 1874, Chang caught bronchitis and died in his sleep. Eng awoke to find his brother dead. Within hours, Eng had passed away as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonynvsSaomarmKTEbrnEppmeqqNkgg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./anderson-silva-net-worth-2024-2.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Anderson Silva Net Worth 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rene-gonzalez.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rene Gonzalez</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
