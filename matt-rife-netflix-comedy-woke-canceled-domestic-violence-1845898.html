That link read "tap to solve your issue" and led people to a website selling helmets for people with special needs.</p><p>People on social media were divided about his jokes, with some labeling the responses as "woke" and part of "cancel culture."</p><p>"This is what happens when you inflate someone's head so much to the point where they think anything they say can just fly.....let's be fr@mattrife isn't "comedian" funny and used his little belt video to get where he's at nowü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è," one person wrote on X, formerly <a href=# data-sys=1 class=multivariate>Twitter</a>.</p><p>But another had a different view: "F*** cancel culture. If you find@mattrife offensive and making a big deal about it.. he accomplished his goal. Comedy is supposed to push boundaries. Shock comedy is a thing. Has been since the start of comedy. I don't support domestic violence but there's a silver lining and a way to find humor in any trauma. If you don't align with his jokes.. don't watch him. Don't talk about him. Don't support him. Simple."</p><p>A third wrote: "Matt Rife really upset some people huh? Then doubled down with the apology. Good. There needs to be people who don't fold. Then all this performative outrage and cancel nonsense stops."</p><p>And a fourth commented: "matt rife might not see your tweets about him being a weird looking misogynistic loser comedian, but other weird looking misogynistic loser comedians might so keep tweeting."</p><figure class="block block-ibtg-article fA" data-gtm-category="Related In-Text A" data-gtm-action=Click></figure><p>The comedian is no stranger to making headlines for statements he makes, including warning Pete Davidson to "run" after he began dating his ex-girlfriend, Kate Beckinsale.</p><p>Rife and the actress dated briefly in 2017 before she moved on with Davidson.</p><p>"Run. Enjoy it. Enjoy it while you can," Rife, told <a href=# data-sys=1 class=multivariate>TMZ</a> at the time. "I hope they're both happy. I hope that it can build to where it's an established relationship. I haven't spoken to her in a while. I haven't spoken to Pete in the same amount of time, if not longer. I wish them both the best. I hope they're happy. I don't have any solid advice, just be careful."</p><p>Rife's other comedy specials include Matthew Steven Rife and Walking Red Flag. He also appeared on shows such as, Wild 'n Out, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and Fresh Off the Boat.</p><span><i class=uncommon-logo></i></span><h2>Uncommon Knowledge</h2><p class=subtitle-desktop>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p class=subtitle-mobile>Newsweek is committed to challenging conventional wisdom and finding connections in the search for common ground.</p><p>");jQuery(this).remove()}) jQuery('.start-slider').owlCarousel({loop:!1,margin:10,nav:!0,items:1}).on('changed.owl.carousel',function(event){var currentItem=event.item.index;var totalItems=event.item.count;if(currentItem===0){jQuery('.owl-prev').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-prev').removeClass('disabled')} if(currentItem===totalItems-1){jQuery('.owl-next').addClass('disabled')}else{jQuery('.owl-next').removeClass('disabled')}})}})})</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrK6enZtjsLC5jqaYraxdp7ansYynnK2enJ7Fbq%2FOppydsV2svKyxjJyYp5uVobKlecOopJ6rpJ6wbsLIqKOeppOaenKEk25vcnA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./melvin-gordon-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-458349-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>¬´&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Melvin Gordon Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./are-we-still-friends-lyrics.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;¬ª</span><p class=pager__title>Are we still Friends Lyrics</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./coolest-offices.html>9 Of The Worlds Coolest Offices</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./bence-ferenczi-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-43242-html.html>Bence Ferenczi Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ivan-cornejo-car-accident-what-happened-to-ivan-cornejo.html>Ivan Cornejo Car Accident, What Happened to Ivan Cornejo?</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./lane-davies.html>Lane Davies</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./peter-hoeffel-obituary-family-mourns-cause-of-death.html>Peter Hoeffel Obituary: Family Mourns, Cause Of Death</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 DazeBlog.
