The actress opened up about how she stayed strong, active, and healthy at that age; plus, she was a doting grandmother, and her grandchildren have followed in her footsteps!</p><p class=dh>On December 21, 2022, Jane Fonda turned 85 and had a lot to be happy about on her birthday! A few days before her birthday, on December 15, the actress revealed she'd received some great news!</p><p class=dh>In a blog post, the star explained how her oncologist told her the cancer she'd been diagnosed with had gone into remission! The good news continued with Fonda noting that she could discontinue her chemotherapy treatments!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b347ec1b957feca0a9bab655ecd9f54f.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jane Fonda hosts Fire Drill Fridays at a rally in Freedom Plaza on December 2, 2022, in Washington, DC. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The actress shared how blessed and fortunate she felt to receive the news and thanked her fans for their prayers and good wishes, which played a role in her healing. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/jane-fonda-cancer-battle-wants-to-see-grandkids-grow/>mentioned</a> how proud she was to have lived a "productive and intentional life," adding:</p><p class=dh>“I thank all of you who prayed and sent good thoughts my way. I am confident that it played a role in the good news.”</p><p class=dh>The star was also lucky to be close to her three children and two grandchildren, had friends, and had great relationships with some of her exes. A friend said Fonda grew up with a privileged life and didn't complain.</p><p class=dh>The actress was allegedly thankful for the ups and downs she'd experienced in life and wasn't afraid of dying. However, she did explain that she wasn't ready to go but was aware that it would happen soon enough.</p><p class=dh>Reaching 85 wasn't easy, requiring the actress to take extra care of herself. Her routine included getting enough sleep daily, staying active, and eating well.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>How Does Jane Stay Looking So Young?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In a past interview, Fonda revealed that she managed to look younger than her age by taking care of herself. The "Grace and Frankie" actress said she slept eight or nine hours each night.</p><p class=dh>The star shared how she meditated in nature as much as possible because the surrounding brought her joy. Fonda also exercised as she'd <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.glamour.com/story/jane-fonda-cover-story>realized</a> as she got older that staying healthy was a "joyful and critical" practice.</p><p class=dh>The "Book Club" actress <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.glamour.com/story/jane-fonda-cover-story>explained</a> how it had taken her a while to realize one's body was "very forgiving" when one was young. The star said she'd abused her body back then but being older now, when she drank too much for one night or didn't sleep sufficiently, she weren't fully functional the next day.</p><p class=dh>Fonda didn't like the feeling, which was motivation enough for her to take better care of herself. Despite her age, the actress remained curious by asking people questions and reading many books.</p><p class=dh>She felt staying curious as an older person also helped you remain young for a long time. The "Monster-in-Law" star confessed that she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.glamour.com/story/jane-fonda-cover-story>felt</a> "younger" in her 80s than when she was 20!</p><p class=dh>In 2021, Fonda was 83 and <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a20686775/jane-fonda-age/>nowhere close to retiring</a>. The actress explained that she needed steady work and how hard it was to get some regular work as an older actor because people forgot they also had to earn their living.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>However, [Jane] Fonda vowed to keep fighting for as long as she could.</strong></h3><p class=dh>She said she supported other people besides herself and needed an income, and found it fun. <a class="me a" href=#>Fonda</a> shared how she'd never thought at her age she'd be working too hard to make time for self-pampering but was happy with her circumstances.</p><p class=dh>Besides being a famous Hollywood actress, Fonda had another role that she took quite seriously. The star was a grandparent who doted on her grandchildren, whom she wished to see their futures.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>What Kind of Grandmother Is Fonda?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>In 2022, Fonda had two grandchildren, Malcolm Vadim, 23, in 2022, and Viva Vadim, 20. The grandchildren made her want to be alive for longer, with her <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.prevention.com/fitness/a20686775/jane-fonda-age/>explaining</a>:</p><p class=dh>“I want to see my grandkids get old enough so that I go out knowing that they’re going to be OK."</p><p class=dh>The actress' friend said she was worried about the state of the world and regretted not being able to continue fighting for the Earth for those who needed it most. However, Fonda vowed to keep fighting for as long as she could.</p><p class=dh>The star promised to continue doing her climate change work until she couldn't anymore. Her grandchildren allegedly followed in her footsteps by doing their bit to help bring awareness to the climate change crisis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwcmphaHqrrc2eZJ%2BnnpmubsDUq6WsZWhqerS0xGauqKqbqHqttdWipaBlnKS7b7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taye-diggs-career-earnings-salary-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taye Diggs career earnings, salary and net worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-be-quiet-dark-rock-pro-5-cpu-cooler-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Final Words &amp;amp; Conclusion - The Be Quiet!
